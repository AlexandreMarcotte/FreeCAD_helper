===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 1 - Setup , preferences and navigation - Easy Tutorial for Learning CAD =====
 Hi viewers and welcome to the channel and welcome to new calls for beginners on the free [0:00:04]
 CAD. [0:00:05]
 We can be constructing it around different types of workflows. [0:00:09]
 So in one video we'll show you a part design workflow all the way up to export. [0:00:14]
 In the next video we'll show you a part design workflow all the way up to creating a technical [0:00:19]
 drawing. [0:00:20]
 It's the best way I can think of to explore these work benches and understand how they fit [0:00:25]
 together. [0:00:26]
 The first one is given you a firm grounding in the fundamentals of free CAD to get you [0:00:30]
 up and running. [0:00:32]
 In this first video we'll go through the base it's set up for free CAD and how to set and [0:00:36]
 use navigation in free CAD to get the best out of our experience. [0:00:41]
 In part two we'll start to explore a workflow and model something from the ground up [0:00:46]
 guiding you through the process all the way. [0:00:50]
 So when it comes to using free CAD we'll first go through the installer so that's quite easily [0:00:54]
 done we go over to the free CAD web.org and we download the latest version of free CAD. [0:01:01]
 Now at the top we can see the title we say in the current stable version is 0.19.3. [0:01:09]
 And these are what these buttons are linked to. [0:01:11]
 We've got Windows Mac and Linux there so you just download it for your current OS. [0:01:16]
 If you want more recent build we can come down to the development versions here and we can [0:01:22]
 see we've got wiford builds button. [0:01:25]
 You can click on and this will open up to get a hit-hup page. [0:01:31]
 Normally for the page you have announced about the top so you can see there's a code [0:01:34]
 freeze at the moment because the outcome in version will point to OS being released. [0:01:39]
 We can download those from here down to the assets and we've got the app image for Linux, [0:01:46]
 DMG, for Mac and the 7Z for Windows. [0:01:53]
 And in this case basically downloading those and execute them with the app image because [0:01:59]
 I run non-linux. [0:02:01]
 This is the one I've been downloading. [0:02:04]
 We have to do some additional permission based settings on there so we right click and [0:02:08]
 set the permissions and we're going to show you that in the moment once it's been downloaded. [0:02:12]
 But with Windows you'll be absolutely fine. [0:02:15]
 We can just execute that. [0:02:17]
 With Mac there is again another additional step you have to take to set the permissions [0:02:23]
 on there and I have a video on my channel regarding that and I put that in the show [0:02:27]
 which notes below. [0:02:30]
 Once you ask Cougar or app images being downloaded in my case on Linux so I've got the [0:02:34]
 app image. [0:02:35]
 We'll see in our download directory. [0:02:38]
 Now for Linux I'm going to have to right click and go to the properties and come over [0:02:43]
 to the permissions and this one here allows you file as a program. [0:02:52]
 So we need to set that one to allow to execute and we've got a number of read right access [0:02:58]
 is here access. [0:02:59]
 I'm going to go read right for that one as well and then we can close that and just [0:03:04]
 by double clicking on this we may want to rename it as well. [0:03:07]
 This should just run and you can see free can has started to open and we're starting to load [0:03:13]
 it. [0:03:14]
 Once it has loaded I'm going to go up to view and place it into full screen mode so we have [0:03:21]
 more real estate to work with. [0:03:24]
 Now we'll have a look at free can to get an understanding of how it works. [0:03:28]
 So if we have stored free can and now we need to know how to use it and if you've [0:03:34]
 heard anything about free can you've probably heard about work benches. [0:03:39]
 We've dropped down this icon here or this drop down you can see a number of work benches [0:03:44]
 within here. [0:03:46]
 These work benches work together with other work benches and they can be mixed and matched [0:03:51]
 as we go along. [0:03:52]
 So if you're from a traditional CAD process something like from AutoCAD or Fusion you may [0:04:00]
 find that this is a bit of a learning curve to get through. [0:04:03]
 Free can does it somewhat differently. [0:04:05]
 For instance we have the schedule work bench here. [0:04:09]
 This allows us to do 2D sketches which we are screwed up at into free default. [0:04:15]
 To screwed up those into free default we can use the part design, the part, the curves, [0:04:21]
 or combination of part and curves or even part design and part. [0:04:26]
 Now before you go for running from the hills once you get your head around what tools [0:04:31]
 are in where and how they can be used is quite simple. [0:04:35]
 The sketcher and the part design are the easy path. [0:04:40]
 So if you're coming from traditional CAD processes with traditional software these are [0:04:47]
 the best ones to use these to hear. [0:04:49]
 If you're doing something with NURP surfaces then you'll use something like the Curse [0:04:53]
 Workbench. [0:04:54]
 Now you won't see that in your drop down because these are additional workbench. [0:04:59]
 This Curse Workbench is an additional workbench that's been added. [0:05:04]
 So as well as the RAGE Workbench is what we have here. [0:05:08]
 We can come over to the tools and go onto the panel manager. [0:05:13]
 So when you come into the panel manager you opt to manually get this well-contradable manager [0:05:17]
 in the saying that these are not official parts of free CAD. [0:05:21]
 So these are what people have created and submitted to free CAD and are included in the [0:05:26]
 add-ons. [0:05:27]
 We hear OK. [0:05:30]
 These are all the workbench that we can install. [0:05:33]
 So there's a vast array of different workbench. [0:05:36]
 Now the thing is that we don't have to learn or them. [0:05:43]
 We may only use say two workbenches. [0:05:47]
 But once we get more competent in CAD we'll utilize a number of workbenches in our work [0:05:52]
 flow. [0:05:54]
 So before we start with free CAD we need to set some preferences. [0:05:58]
 So we come up to edit preferences. [0:06:03]
 We can see we've got the preferences window in front of us. [0:06:06]
 Now in here we set our language when the general tab and we can see the general icon is [0:06:14]
 let it. [0:06:16]
 We set the language so we can change the language in here. [0:06:19]
 Now if we come down to the bottom we've got some visual preferences here as well. [0:06:24]
 So we've got style sheets at the moment I've got no style sheet but we can change the [0:06:29]
 general look. [0:06:30]
 So if you like a dark style we can go for pro darker, etc. [0:06:34]
 We've got the size of the icons. [0:06:35]
 You can see mine is set to large and we can go actually larger, etc. [0:06:39]
 The reason why I've got mine set to large is because of demonstration purposes. [0:06:44]
 So we see it to demonstrate with larger icons. [0:06:47]
 If you apply that, apply it to the background, you can see the icons have increased in size [0:06:51]
 there and I guess it might back. [0:06:54]
 But if you've got a larger monitor we can increase the icons size, etc. [0:07:00]
 Now I've got this start up we can decide which module we want to start with. [0:07:05]
 So what workbench we want to start in. [0:07:06]
 I've just left my map at start. [0:07:09]
 Let's come back up to the top and look for some of the preferences. [0:07:13]
 Now one of the ones that you need to set is over on the units. [0:07:19]
 So we set the unit system here. [0:07:22]
 Now I've got my set to millimeters and standard but we've got the US inch pounds, [0:07:29]
 we've got imperial, etc. [0:07:31]
 So we can set whatever we want in here. [0:07:34]
 Now if you use free camp before, one of the annoying things is the error messages that are [0:07:41]
 appear. [0:07:42]
 So when you go and do something, you'll either get a wall in the inner or error and it will pop [0:07:47]
 up in the report view. [0:07:49]
 Something called the report view and it's shrinks, it's screened down and you'll see down [0:07:52]
 the bottom a panel that is basically a text box showing the error message. [0:07:58]
 You can turn these off on the output window. [0:08:00]
 You've got this show report view on error. [0:08:03]
 I'll check that one. [0:08:04]
 Show report view. [0:08:05]
 And show report through for normal. [0:08:08]
 So everything here needs to be unchecked. [0:08:11]
 That says show report view on error warning or message, [0:08:14]
 mod messages, etc. [0:08:16]
 Once that's done, we can come over to the display properties. [0:08:20]
 And here we can set the camera type. [0:08:25]
 So I've got my set to off a graphic rendering out the box. [0:08:29]
 Comes out the box as this so we can set it there. [0:08:32]
 But we've got perspective rendering as well. [0:08:34]
 We've also got colors. [0:08:37]
 So if you're not happy with the gradient background that you'll see, [0:08:41]
 then we can change those here. [0:08:44]
 So for example, that's kind of wild here and create a new document. [0:08:49]
 You'll see it's gradient background here. [0:08:52]
 And at any time, we can come into edit preferences and come over to the display [0:09:00]
 and come down to colors, which is up here. [0:09:05]
 And we've got a simple color for background color. [0:09:08]
 And we can choose which color we want. [0:09:11]
 So I'm going to go for, say, that's keep it as a white and apply that. [0:09:16]
 And you can see that's applied there. [0:09:20]
 And we can set that back just by sitting this back to color gradient. [0:09:24]
 If we go into a state that we've changed all the preferences [0:09:27]
 and we want to go back to the beginning, [0:09:29]
 then we've got this reset button down the left hand side. [0:09:32]
 Just click that. [0:09:34]
 And this will clear all the user settings. [0:09:37]
 And if it yes, everything goes back to normal. [0:09:41]
 So at the moment it's not. [0:09:43]
 So that's just exit out and double click freecat. [0:09:48]
 So freecat's open and we're hitting new. [0:09:55]
 And you can see that everything is back to normal. [0:09:58]
 And if I go into edit preferences and come down to my style, [0:10:03]
 let me pause now, let me pause. [0:10:07]
 Had no style sheet on that size of two by our cons. [0:10:12]
 We had custom 30 before we had large 32. [0:10:15]
 So you can see they've been all reset, [0:10:19]
 gonna apply those and hit okay. [0:10:21]
 One other thing that you want to change is the way [0:10:24]
 the navigation in set. [0:10:26]
 This is the way you're navigate freecat with your pulse or input device. [0:10:30]
 So [0:10:31]
 down in Q site and corner, you can see we've got this [0:10:34]
 the icon here and it's set to CAD. For click that we'll see a number of different navigation [0:10:41]
 options. So we got CAD, we got Blender, we got Jester, etc. I'm using laptop so I'm using [0:10:48]
 Touchpad so I click on Touchpad you can see that's changed and this also gives me the navigation [0:10:55]
 shortcuts as well. So if I hover over the top of this we can see that the Touchpad navigation [0:11:01]
 is done is showing what buttons that you use for zoom rotates, per and etc. Now Touchpad [0:11:09]
 is not just for laptops with a Touchpad, it's also for a mouse as well. So if I hover over [0:11:14]
 that you can see we've got the SLEEPZZOOM, the ROTATES and the shortcut keys that we use [0:11:22]
 to actually control these. So if I zoomed I can see I need to use SHIFT and CONTROL, push [0:11:28]
 and back and forth on that mousepad there. Now when you're starting to freak out for the [0:11:33]
 first time it's best to have a play with these to get an idea of how it works. So I'm [0:11:38]
 going to use this drop down to SLEEPZOOM or workbench and we're going to place basically [0:11:42]
 a simple sketch in here. So click on the sketch, we see that we've got all these icons here [0:11:49]
 so I'm going to create a new sketch, got this icon here to create a new sketch, all got [0:11:55]
 to sketch and create a sketch. We're going to be asked for a play. Now this is not to [0:12:02]
 worry about for the time being we're just going to get used to navigation. So let the [0:12:06]
 X Y play for now. Here okay, what you'll see is that these tools have all been activated. [0:12:15]
 Now your stream may look different to mind because my icons are larger. If you do see [0:12:21]
 difference in here, what you can do is drag and drop these toolbars so you can see if I move [0:12:28]
 over this divider here these dots, I can drag and drop these to where I want and some maybe [0:12:36]
 restricted down so this one here you can see we've got the two Chevron points to the right. [0:12:43]
 That means we've got more options underneath. I just want to add a simple shape so I'm going [0:12:50]
 to find my circle up here and just click on it and just add the circle anywhere on the screen. [0:12:59]
 So drop in there you can see we've what's known as auto constraint to this line here [0:13:05]
 with this here is a tangency constraint. We're going into that later we just need something [0:13:11]
 on the screen to start with. You can come over and hit close. Now you see we have the [0:13:17]
 sketch on the left hand side and some geometry. So we're going to learn how to navigate with [0:13:23]
 this geometry. First thing I want to show you is the navigation cube up the top right here. [0:13:30]
 If you come from Blender this normally called a Gizmo. It's basically the same kind of thing. [0:13:37]
 It's a cube that we can slap different planes from or the different viewpoints. Now this [0:13:42]
 was placed along the X Y plane and that's looking down so if we look and the navigation [0:13:49]
 cube and also come down to the bottom you'll see another item here which shows the axis. [0:13:56]
 We can now learn how to navigate. So one way to navigate is to use the cube so I can click [0:14:02]
 as you can see I'm rolling over the top where it's this top here. It's highlighting. Click [0:14:07]
 that we can come to the top view and we can use left and the right arrows here. Now this [0:14:16]
 is a slow way of navigating but we can slap those planes and get where we want. Also we've [0:14:26]
 got this rotate left and rotate right here. Now if we come down to our control method and [0:14:37]
 hover over it we can see we've got the navigation style so I'm looking at the rotates so I can see [0:14:44]
 I need to use alt and move my mouse left or right. So this gives that go so I'm going to hold [0:14:52]
 down alt it will be different depending on what navigation you've selected and I'm going to move my [0:14:57]
 mouse left and right and you can see how that's rotating. Now it's where if I've selected for this [0:15:06]
 from so I've gone over here and you can see I'm moving left and right holding the alt key down [0:15:12]
 and moving across the mouse pad or moving the mouse and if I come in here you can see that it's [0:15:21]
 navigating around but it's moving in a way that is not centered upon anywhere so I want to actually [0:15:30]
 almost like rotate the viewpoint around this object. To do that if I move my mouse over the top of [0:15:39]
 it you can see it has a roll over color. When that color changes now I press Alt and move this around [0:15:48]
 you can see we've got more control rather than coming around here roll over and there's more control [0:15:56]
 and we can use basically any point along here to do that. That's add something else that sketch [0:16:05]
 so I'm going to come over to this tree view here at the combo view and this is the sketch that we're [0:16:11]
 created. Let's double clicker and come up to the circle click the circle you can see how in the mouse [0:16:18]
 point for us change it's got the circle there with cross hairs that means that we're going to [0:16:24]
 actually create a circle and I'm going to place a circle down in the right hand side here click once [0:16:29]
 and drag out and click again so we're created that circle. Sick clothes now we've got two circles [0:16:40]
 so if I hover over this one hold down Alt and move this you can see how I'm moving around this circle [0:16:47]
 or hover over this one press Alt you can see how I've kept that centered that circle there's [0:16:54]
 centered so we have control of how we want to rotate so it's worth just playing with this to get an [0:17:06]
 idea of how this works. The other one is zoom in and zoom out so that's hover over my navigation [0:17:15]
 controls and for me I can see that my zoom is ira shift plus control back and forth or using the [0:17:25]
 mouse will so let's give that one a go so you come back I'm using the key and moving back and forth [0:17:37]
 so moving those back and forth and you can see that my mouse point face change you can see I've [0:17:49]
 got it up and down arrow and you'll find that if you're using laptop then you can use two fingers [0:17:56]
 to zoom as well going back and forth but I'm just going to try those whoops I haven't done it there [0:18:02]
 so shift control and back and forth and we'll try that back and forth like so using the mouse [0:18:14]
 will it will have a different effect you can zoom in on parts like I'm doing here see what mouse [0:18:19]
 is over here and my mouse is over here as well so we've got different types of zoom as well [0:18:27]
 or we can use the shift and control and go back and forth like so now the other thing that I've [0:18:34]
 actually done the bun there is actually move my view point so that one if I hover over we can see the [0:18:42]
 move holding down the shift and changing the position on screen with my mouse so that's basically [0:18:53]
 navigation there with the cube as well you can see as we move around the screen the cube changes so [0:19:02]
 the cube reflects where we are in for a least base you can click the points of this cube as well [0:19:10]
 and the sights and this point here we can go around them to place that into position [0:19:18]
 we can change what type of perspective we have there also if you're of say this is off the [0:19:26]
 screen here how do we get it back and this is important to learn as well if you come out to the top [0:19:31]
 lat hand side here you've got a little and we've also got a fixed selection so if I click [0:19:39]
 fiddle that fits the whole of that to the screen so that mat where this is this could be off [0:19:47]
 somewhere miles away and we just click fiddle and it brings it back so if you get lost and you [0:19:55]
 don't know where your model or your sketches gone then just use this one here the fiddle [0:20:01]
 fid selection is basically if we select it something in here and go fid selection then that will [0:20:08]
 actually fit that selection on the screen we've only got one selection at the moment and this doesn't [0:20:13]
 work with selecting individual edges here like these circles if I create a new sketch in here [0:20:22]
 xy plane and we're create another circle these aren't inside this sketch so I just can create [0:20:29]
 another circle in here place it in the middle like so and hit close matter fact let's go back in [0:20:36]
 and I'm just going to delete that so I'm using a box selection so I'm clicking and dragging [0:20:44]
 around this circle I'm going to hit delete on the keyboard and I'm just going to move this [0:20:51]
 over this way some way and then keep on going and just place a circle over here [0:20:58]
 so place a circle over here so now what we've got if I zoom out we've got this circle over there [0:21:05]
 so if I'm zooming in and if I hit fiddle we fit everything to the screen [0:21:14]
 I zoom in here and this time I select that new sketch we created and go fit selection and that [0:21:26]
 brings that sketch into the center of the screen click the other one fit selection and we've [0:21:35]
 gone to the other side as well so we've gone to the other sketch and pulled that in so I'm [0:21:40]
 flicking back and forth between the sides and that's important because you'll get yourself lost [0:21:46]
 so if I'm really zoom out and I just add in some rotation I don't know where everything is so I [0:21:54]
 want to go back to this sketch and go fit selection and we're back in business now if we look down [0:22:02]
 on the right hand side we have an access controller down here access handler this tells us where [0:22:09]
 about we are in 3D space and this reflects what's on our cube at the top so we can come around [0:22:17]
 let's click on bottom you can see we've got the the access sitting there and we've got green [0:22:26]
 red and blue for the different accesses so the yx and z axis so at the moment the z axis is running [0:22:37]
 this way and the x axis is running down and the y axis is running this way and it's reflected [0:22:46]
 over here as well we can see that we've got red, blue and the green and the other thing that I need to [0:22:52]
 show you is the x-cross so if I come up to view and toggle x-is cross and zoom out [0:23:02]
 nice fit to screen you can see down here in the middle of the screen is the access [0:23:12]
 so this is the x-cross and this is basically the point of origin so when we create something [0:23:21]
 it will be credited around the point of origin in part two we'll start to explore workflow [0:23:29]
 and model something from the ground up guiding you through the process all the way [0:23:33]
