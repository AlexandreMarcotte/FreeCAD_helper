===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 9 - Modelling Lipped Containers - Multibody Workflow - Part Design =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning [0:00:04]
 FreeCAD for beginners. [0:00:05]
 We will teach the fundamentals for freecad from a beginner's perspective as we understand [0:00:10]
 workflows. [0:00:11]
 In this video we can be using the previous skills that we've developed to create some [0:00:15]
 containers. [0:00:16]
 We're going to be using the part designed and following a multi-body workflow. [0:00:22]
 This allows us to do the lid and the bottom of the container or the box. [0:00:27]
 Our first example will be using the revolve and we'll end up with something that [0:00:32]
 looks like this. [0:00:35]
 So we have a cylindrical container that has a lid that runs all the way around it along [0:00:39]
 with fitted lid. [0:00:41]
 In our next example we're going to be following the same workflow in the part designed [0:00:45]
 with multiple bodies. [0:00:47]
 This time we can create a different shape and we're going to be using the sweep or the [0:00:52]
 additive pipe to create that. [0:00:54]
 The end result is going to be something a bit more different where we end up with a [0:01:00]
 shaped box or a shape container that again has a bottom and lid that fit together. [0:01:07]
 As you can see you can't use a revolve of this and we'll be showing you the techniques [0:01:12]
 of how we will create such a model. [0:01:13]
 I hope you enjoy this series and let's have a look at these techniques. [0:01:18]

 So in free CAD and I can create a new document. [0:01:46]
 We're going to be using the part design and the first example I'm going to show you is [0:01:52]
 this standard circular box and that's quite simple to do. [0:01:57]
 We can create a body and create a new sketch. [0:02:02]
 We can use multiple work flow so I'm going to go along the XZ plane and I'm going to create [0:02:09]
 the profile for the top of the box. [0:02:12]
 So I'm going to start with a polyline and come out and say about here. [0:02:18]
 This is going to be the top I'm able to have a curve line in here while I go to that [0:02:23]
 in a minute and the shape we're looking for is basically a step in here. [0:02:29]
 So we're looking at something like this and we're coming across. [0:02:36]
 What we're looking for is just the profile of the box to allow for the revolve. [0:02:42]
 The hit scale in the mouse pointed back and just had some constraints in here. [0:02:47]
 So we've got point on line constraint and make sure that's straight as well. [0:02:53]
 And again for this one. [0:02:56]
 When this revolve, this leaves step and we can make a box and that connects up in here. [0:03:02]
 So we may want some constraints in here so I'm going to the constraint these two points [0:03:07]
 or this line with horizontal constraint. [0:03:12]
 Now remember this is half of the box that we're looking at. [0:03:16]
 So if I want a 50mm read box, I'm going to also put 25mm in there. [0:03:22]
 Okay and also remember when you're sketching that if you're making a smaller box, you end [0:03:29]
 up getting something like this so you have to repair this to the shape that we want. [0:03:36]
 So it's always worth getting the first line in so we could get this line in first and dimension [0:03:40]
 it and then start sketching off of that so this gives you an idea of what size you're [0:03:45]
 dimensioning that. [0:03:47]
 That's at the height of the emulators and I may place up these two over quality and we'll [0:04:00]
 bring this one down and I might make this one and this one equals as well. [0:04:06]
 So we've got this step in here and we'll set some length in here as well. [0:04:12]
 So I'll put a free mill and I'll be free mill there and you may want to decide that this [0:04:17]
 will be a short distance but that doesn't matter for the time being we can always put that [0:04:22]
 in. [0:04:23]
 Let's just bring this constraint down and we'll set a height in here so this will be the [0:04:31]
 width of the box and I'm going to make that round that two mill there. [0:04:35]
 So that's a profile that's hit close and we'll use a revolve or a plant design. [0:04:42]
 Crane-handed feature and revolution. [0:04:44]
 That makes the revolution across the vertical sketch axis so we've got the top all [0:04:52]
 lid of the box that we want to create. [0:04:56]
 Now we want to create the bottom so we're going to come around to the front make sure nothing [0:05:00]
 is selected so we've got nothing selected in here and create a body. [0:05:06]
 So this is a new body that we're creating now. [0:05:09]
 One here I'm going to rename this body to top and we're going to start building the [0:05:17]
 bottom of the body. [0:05:19]
 For that I need to reference this top shape to allow for a closer fit. [0:05:23]
 To do that I'm going to use a shape binding I'll show you the reason is wind moment. [0:05:27]
 That's the reason I'm going to rename this to bomb. [0:05:35]
 And this one is bold at my minutes to less an active body. [0:05:38]
 So if this one was bold and in these sketches we'll actually go into here. [0:05:41]
 This is not bold just right click to go right to the body that I've become bold or [0:05:45]
 double clicker. [0:05:46]
 We'll create a new sketch now and we want to place this along the exit plane. [0:05:54]
 So that's placed in there you can see that in the model we've got the bottom and we've got the [0:05:59]
 sketch that sits there. [0:06:02]
 I'm going to use the section view to cross section through this. [0:06:06]
 We'll also go from sketch view section. [0:06:11]
 So cross section in there and I want to pull in some geometry in here. [0:06:19]
 We're going to get into a bit of trouble here because if we're trying to reference any [0:06:24]
 of this you can see we've got a stop point in that appearing and if you look down to the [0:06:29]
 bottom the mesh says that object belongs to another body can't link. [0:06:33]
 And this is because we're trying to do multiple modeling but reference the upper body. [0:06:38]
 And you can't actually do that for a cat what you've got to do is pull in some geometry [0:06:42]
 from the top into the bottom. [0:06:45]
 So from our top body and pull in the geometry into the bottom body. [0:06:50]
 There are a number of ways to do in that the best way is to use a shape binder or a [0:06:54]
 subject binder. [0:06:55]
 So that's close this sketch. [0:06:58]
 What I'm going to do actually is I'm not going to reference this revolve. [0:07:01]
 I'm going to hide that revolve so click on the revolve and press the space bar and come [0:07:06]
 in and show the sketch. [0:07:08]
 So this is the revolution of the sketch and I'm going to come in. [0:07:15]
 But the bottom edge control click this edge and this edge and these are the edges that [0:07:23]
 I'm going to reference. [0:07:25]
 Now there's a little green icon here called create a subject binder also available from [0:07:30]
 part design. [0:07:31]
 Create a sub object shaped binder. [0:07:33]
 Now before I click on it looks left you see that the bottom body is in bold. [0:07:39]
 If I click that now we get the binder added to this binder here. [0:07:44]
 That's hide at the top body sketch, for present space bar and we've got this edge that's [0:07:51]
 been distracted out. [0:07:54]
 If the underlying sketch changes in size this will change as well. [0:07:58]
 Because it's in the same body as my sketch I can reference it. [0:08:05]
 So that's coming to that sketch part of a click on it. [0:08:07]
 You can see we've got this here. [0:08:10]
 So this allows me to do the bottom body. [0:08:13]
 So we can come in here and start pulling in this in as reference geometry. [0:08:18]
 I'm going to use this tool here to external geometry and pull this in. [0:08:25]
 Like so and we know that there's another one here. [0:08:30]
 So I can reference this. [0:08:31]
 Now one thing we've got to think about when doing this is tolerances. [0:08:35]
 So I'm going to sketch the bottom body with a tolerance to this. [0:08:39]
 Let's zoom out a little and we can see where it's going to be revolved around. [0:08:43]
 So this point here. [0:08:47]
 Let's come in and use the pulley line again to look across. [0:08:51]
 See the pulley line here. [0:08:53]
 And I'm going to add the bottom of the body to say about here. [0:08:59]
 Come up and I'm going to attach to this point. [0:09:05]
 Come along and come past this point here. [0:09:08]
 See past this point. [0:09:09]
 To have a bit of space. [0:09:11]
 And we've gone over constraint because of this one but we carry on. [0:09:16]
 We come up and come across so it's in line. [0:09:21]
 And we add our shape because I want this hollow. [0:09:25]
 I'm exaggerating the sizes of these and I know that we're going to orange because we're [0:09:29]
 over constraint. [0:09:30]
 We've got our water constraints on and we're just all to constraint until all those are [0:09:34]
 never saw this line out in a minute. [0:09:36]
 Click this redundant constraint and hit the lead. [0:09:39]
 We've got those there. [0:09:40]
 Let's come in and make sure that these points are connected which they are. [0:09:47]
 Click on front and we can start adding some constraints in here. [0:09:53]
 So I can see we've got this one here. [0:09:55]
 I'm going to use these two and set them some distance away. [0:10:01]
 So first of all make sure that we haven't got that line selected. [0:10:04]
 Make sure we select the points and use a distance. [0:10:07]
 And so they're not 0.25 millimeters and the same here so [0:10:14]
 this point from this point. [0:10:17]
 Just that height in there. [0:10:20]
 I'll have more point to two five. [0:10:23]
 Now set this height. [0:10:27]
 10 mil. [0:10:32]
 I'll take this point and this point and make sure they're in line. [0:10:39]
 And then we can just set the depths here so I don't need to constrain this one but I'm going to [0:10:45]
 come down and constrain this one instead. [0:10:48]
 To that two millimeters. [0:10:52]
 So we've got that one there. [0:10:54]
 If I hit close now you can see we've got that. [0:10:57]
 And if I'm about the top body in the revolution, trust us, [0:11:01]
 baseball you see how that sits in there. [0:11:04]
 We've some distance away. [0:11:06]
 And click on that sketch. [0:11:10]
 That bottom sketch there and use the revolve. [0:11:15]
 You use the tool bar revolve down and that's revolved around there. [0:11:17]
 And I hit OK. [0:11:19]
 We can do some finer adjustments. [0:11:22]
 Perhaps this top is too large. [0:11:24]
 Or this bottom is these two smalls come to the sketch and just change. [0:11:30]
 This one here to go page up 50 millimeters. [0:11:38]
 There we go. [0:11:39]
 So we've got that there and hit close. [0:11:43]
 So we've got that one now. [0:11:46]
 So that's all done. [0:11:48]
 One thing to remember about this is that we can't come in. [0:11:53]
 And so click the top and have a look at it by [0:11:57]
 right click Transforming and Rotating this up and pulling this away. [0:12:02]
 And hit OK because what this happens. [0:12:06]
 We start ripping the model apart with the constraints. [0:12:11]
 The controls are that. [0:12:12]
 And control. [0:12:17]
 So what do we do? [0:12:20]
 Well we've got this clone tool here. [0:12:21]
 Create a clone. [0:12:24]
 Also on part design. [0:12:25]
 Create a clone. [0:12:26]
 So if we want to look at these separately to the side that we rotate them, [0:12:33]
 etc. [0:12:34]
 But we just make clones of both of these from here. [0:12:38]
 So click on the top. [0:12:40]
 Create a clone. [0:12:40]
 Let's clone one of them. [0:12:43]
 We can now transform that so that body 002 can right click. [0:12:47]
 Transform. [0:12:49]
 Move this out the way. [0:12:51]
 OK. [0:12:52]
 And we'll do the same for the body. [0:12:54]
 Click on that one body. [0:12:55]
 And use a clone tool or part design. [0:12:57]
 Create clone. [0:12:58]
 And right click Transform. [0:13:02]
 And place this out the way. [0:13:05]
 Like so. [0:13:06]
 So now we can do what we want with these. [0:13:09]
 We can right click Transform. [0:13:12]
 We can even model on top of these if we so desire. [0:13:15]
 And move that up. [0:13:18]
 And we can see if I hit OK. [0:13:21]
 Everything's fine. [0:13:22]
 And we can look inside that and see in there. [0:13:24]
 So to do the same with something that will also you're an oval or a different shape, [0:13:29]
 then we can't use a revolve because that's full of circular objects. [0:13:32]
 We have to take a different approach and that's where the sweet comes in handy. [0:13:35]
 We're the part design game of creating new document and create a new body and a new sketch. [0:13:40]
 And we place it along the x-white plane and here OK. [0:13:43]
 Now if I just sketch the top of this container or this box, [0:13:49]
 we'll see that we can't use the profiles for revolutions. [0:13:56]
 If I was doing something like this. [0:13:59]
 So I've got two arcs and I've got something like this. [0:14:05]
 And that's tangent to there. [0:14:08]
 To done that, I need the tangent to the alpha. [0:14:10]
 I just hit controls then and we're place another one. [0:14:14]
 So I'm here to here and curve this outwards. [0:14:18]
 I go to use the tangency now and to use the tangency against these two. [0:14:24]
 OK that and these two. [0:14:27]
 OK that and tangency against these. [0:14:31]
 OK that and these. [0:14:34]
 OK. [0:14:37]
 Hit escape and we'll bring this out a little bit. [0:14:42]
 So I'll be like that and use the trim tool. [0:14:46]
 And I'm going to trim away this arc and this arc. [0:14:50]
 So I've got this shape here. [0:14:51]
 If I hit close, you can see that while we can't make a profile of this to allow [0:14:57]
 to use the revolve tool. [0:14:59]
 That's one here. [0:15:00]
 So what do we do? [0:15:01]
 Will we drop into a sweep or an additive pipe workflow? [0:15:05]
 That's take it from the front and first of all click on that sketch [0:15:10]
 and create a pad of around two millimeters to make the bottom. [0:15:16]
 I now go into create a profile on this. [0:15:19]
 No seven constraints down but we just go for speed for this one to show you how you would do this. [0:15:24]
 I'm going to make sure that I've got nothing selected in our create a sketch. [0:15:29]
 And what I'm doing here is create a sketch. [0:15:33]
 Basically along this plane and I'm going to place a sketch along here on these sides here. [0:15:38]
 So the exit plane will use the section view so we can see through that [0:15:44]
 and we haven't got a seam so I'm just going to take the top line, the import, [0:15:53]
 the import geometry tool, that top line there. [0:15:56]
 That brings that line in there. [0:15:59]
 And now I can start adding the profile. [0:16:03]
 I'm going to use the polyline and we'll add some kind of profile in here. [0:16:09]
 Something like this, it's really bringing around the front so I can see what I'm doing. [0:16:15]
 And we'll come down connect up to this point and this point here, [0:16:22]
 we're going to add constraints, click to select and delete. [0:16:24]
 And I'm going to leave that like that to make it a bit more interesting. [0:16:31]
 As it closed and you'll fully constrain that but this is just getting an idea of what we're doing. [0:16:37]
 And we'll take that sketch, use the Asave pipe and then add edges. [0:16:47]
 So I'm going to click on this edge, you can see the madden, add edge, [0:16:51]
 this edge and we just people going around adding the edges as we go. [0:16:57]
 So I've done the other faceless remove that, add edge and we can see how they're going to be, [0:17:07]
 I did in there. So create the bottom there, that's here, okay. [0:17:12]
 And now we've got that running all the way around that so we're getting a much more interesting [0:17:21]
 shape that we can use. And to do the top, well that's rename that body to bottom. [0:17:31]
 And we'll create a new body, rename that. [0:17:38]
 Top body. [0:17:42]
 That's hide that bottom body in a minute so we can see what's in there. [0:17:50]
 And coming to the sketch in the Asave pipe press space bar. [0:17:55]
 So that we need to actually show that body to hide to actually see the sketch and quickly [0:18:04]
 add it to the Asave pipe and hide it and set because if I hide that body that's going to hide [0:18:08]
 that sketch in there as well. So we've got this profile, I need to create the reverse of this [0:18:16]
 to sweep around this way. For that the top body is our active body, we can see that's in bold. [0:18:24]
 And this is important because I need to reference this sketch inside here because if I try to [0:18:30]
 create a sketch in here and what I want to do is place this along the [0:18:34]
 except plane. Then if I try to import this geometry to make the top, it's not going to allow me to do [0:18:43]
 that. So come out and use the shape binary as there so I'm in the part design and we click on that [0:18:51]
 sketch. This sketch is our profile and this sketch in our bottom body is the sketch that we want to [0:18:59]
 bind to so come up to part design and create a substrate binder that'll place it in the top [0:19:05]
 body. So it's sitting there in the same space that we can actually reference. Let's double click on [0:19:11]
 that sketch that we was trying to reference out from. Now if I try to import the geometry here we're [0:19:17]
 going to still have problems so if I click on the import geometry tool you can hear it's [0:19:22]
 having problems there and that's because we need to click once and basically get the [0:19:29]
 last point of back or come into the model. See the sketch here, the process base bar, that's hidden [0:19:35]
 that sketch. So that sketch there, process base bar, it's hidden it. So actually sitting on top of [0:19:40]
 there that's the reason why I can't actually select this. And now we should be able to pull in the [0:19:48]
 points of this like so and create the top that I'm going to use for this. I'm going to pull in the [0:19:58]
 bottom as well. So this bottom line, the reason being is because I've got matched the profile to the [0:20:03]
 bottom and you see the reason in the minute. Let's click on the poly line and pull in some of this [0:20:10]
 geometry. So we want to come in here and come down across and up and come across here and back down [0:20:22]
 again. Let's go get the last point back, come in and make sure that these two are in line. [0:20:30]
 Let's bring this across here. Make sure that's got a vertical constraint on [0:20:37]
 and set some width of 0.25mm and the same for the height 0.25mm. [0:20:56]
 And we'll set the height in here as well. 0.25mm. So for this one, 0.25mm and we're going to make [0:21:20]
 sure that this point and this one are in line. So we've got those in line now. So we've got the profile [0:21:30]
 that we want to create the active pipe around here. But we need to path to sweep this around. [0:21:38]
 For that I'm going to bring back the active pipe in the bottom body. So you see that there. [0:21:44]
 And I'm going to use the shape binder again. So I'm looking for an edge. So you can take this edge [0:21:52]
 and control click this one. This one, you know, unselected them. Just paint. So click this one, [0:22:03]
 control click this one. Control click this one. Using shortcuts to move this, I've actually got [0:22:11]
 my finger off the control key. So I'm going to replace it back on the control key and click the [0:22:16]
 other edge then we're okay. This uses shape binder for that. And what'll happen if you look at [0:22:21]
 the top body, we've got enough of winder in there. So now I can click the additive pipe [0:22:27]
 press the space part or hide it. We've got that shape. And now we click the sketch in that top body. [0:22:35]
 I'm going to assign additive feature additive pipe. I'm going to select it in there as an edge [0:22:45]
 and start adding edges. So add edge again and just follow this edge around and edge. [0:22:54]
 And finally add edge and this one. So those are all in there. Okay, we've created the top [0:23:09]
 or the lip for that. So we bring back the additive pipe and we can see what it looks like. [0:23:16]
 Now we've got close to top. To do that, I'm going to use not a shape binder but a clone [0:23:23]
 because we have this base. So this pad here. Inside that pad, I have a sketch. So in the [0:23:34]
 click on that sketch, press the space part, we can see that sketch there. I need to take that sketch [0:23:39]
 and place it on top of here. So I need a cop here or I need a clone it. That way they will be [0:23:48]
 kept in sync with each other. So we've got the sketch selected in the bottom body. We don't use the [0:23:56]
 clone from the part design. This is for cloning bodies. We don't want that. This won't help us. [0:24:02]
 This will create it in a body and create a new sketch in that body which is no good to us. [0:24:08]
 If we come over to the draft workbench, you see where that grid in that's appeared there. We can [0:24:13]
 turn that off by this icon down here. We don't need that. That's take the sketch in the bottom [0:24:19]
 body. Kind of modifications and then click clone. We clone that sketch now and if we click on the [0:24:28]
 sketch, press the space part, we have the clone of the sketch here. It's in the bottom. But if you [0:24:34]
 look at the support and the map mode, they are deactivated at the moment. There's no support. [0:24:40]
 And also it sits out the top body. It sits outside of it. Click on the sketch, hold down the last [0:24:47]
 corner and drag that into the top body. It's now in the top body but it's still sitting on the bottom. [0:24:54]
 So now we've got that sketch in there. We need to place it. Click on the sketch and come into the [0:25:00]
 map mode. At the moment it's deactivated. Click on that. It hasn't got a support yet so we're going to [0:25:05]
 select something to attach this to. Now you have to have to play with the faces to get the right [0:25:12]
 attachment. But we've got some tools down the bottom here to place it as well. So I'm going to select [0:25:18]
 this face here. It's round the wrong way so we can come down and rotate this around the x-axis. [0:25:27]
 So rotate that round and then we can use the position in if that's not position correctly. I've [0:25:35]
 actually picked the right face to place it up on. So let's click top and come in and we can do [0:25:44]
 180 on there and that's selected in there. But we've got the in wide direction and in z direction [0:25:53]
 is et cetera. If we can't place that. So that's placed in there and everything's okay here okay [0:26:02]
 and now it's just a case. I'm selecting that sketch. Now I've got a support. It's mapped to flat face [0:26:09]
 and come over to the part design and add a pad. That's padded now and we've set the pad so [0:26:19]
 it might 2mm to add the top to that and we're here okay. So now we've got a closed case for the [0:26:30]
 shape we've created. Remember we can change this profile as well. It's now for a different shape fit [0:26:37]
 and what I'm going to do is come in and because I can't really move these if I try to move these [0:26:46]
 these will go into error. I'm going to use the clone tool to clone the top and the bottom also [0:26:52]
 available from part design and create clone. This means I can hide the top and the bottom. So these [0:27:00]
 two presents spacebar. I've got these here and these are safe to move so I can right click transform [0:27:06]
 and move these up and out away. So I'm going to move this one down and rotate that one [0:27:16]
 forwards so we can see inside there. So that shows you the different shapes you can make with the [0:27:27]
 sweep or the attitude of pipe the sweep is in the part that has to pipe is in the part design. [0:27:32]
 Now next video we're going to be looking at a surface in and how we can create curvature [0:27:37]
 with some basic modeling techniques. So I hope you enjoy these videos and I hope you see [0:27:42]
 in next time. If you like we have seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a co-fire or a [0:27:48]
