===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 10 - Curved surfaces using Surface Workflow - Part Design =====
 Hi, I welcome back to another episode of the Learning Free CAD for beginners, where we teach [0:00:04]
 the fundamentals of free CAD whilst we learn workflows and how to use the numerous work benches [0:00:10]
 in free CAD to create our models. In this episode we're looking at a surfacing workflow. [0:00:16]
 In our main example we'll be using the SketchUp and the part workbench to create the [0:00:21]
 skeletal recurred dish which we will later surface in the surface workbench by using the fill [0:00:26]
 intervals. Before we get into that we're going to be using the SketchUp and learning how to just use [0:00:32]
 the SketchUp with surfacing tools such as rule surface and the fill intervals in the surface workbench. [0:00:39]
 Our end result that we're working towards is this curved dish. We'll be going deeper into the surface [0:00:45]
 workbench in future tutorials and it also cover the bases for more advanced tutorials. As the [0:00:51]
 surface workbench is essential for such things as NIRP surfaces which I've covered in some [0:00:55]
 videos on my channel but I'm going to go into more depth in the future. So I hope you're enjoying [0:01:01]
 these tutorials and let's have a look at this workflow. If you like we've seen please subscribe to [0:01:06]
 the site. I also have a co-fire or a coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that's [0:01:12]
 at ko-hifinfide.com, 4-m-a-n-g-0, also run a patreon where you can subscribe and get extra content. [0:01:21]
 That's at www.pictureon.com, 4-mangojelly solutions. Any money that's kindly donated will be used [0:01:28]
 to span the channel. So for this tutorial we're going to be using two types of surfaces. We're [0:01:33]
 going to be using the rule surface over in the part workbench. This one here also available from [0:01:38]
 parts and coming down to create rule surface and we're going to be using over in the surface workbench. [0:01:47]
 This surface here the fill in. Also available from surface and fill in. Let's start off with [0:01:57]
 the rule surface. So first of all we need something to create the rule surface against. I'm going [0:02:02]
 to be using the sketch or a couple of sketches. It doesn't matter. We can do one sketch. That's [0:02:09]
 going for the xy plane. I just do a plan of sketch first of all and what we need for rule surface [0:02:15]
 is a single edge. So if I use this line here and say use an arc, like so, I can create a surface [0:02:24]
 quite easy against these. Now if I hit close you'll see those two there. Now it's important [0:02:32]
 that it's a single edge. This only works with single edges. So I come over to the part workbench. [0:02:38]
 I can control select both edges. So select one. Control select the other and create a rule [0:02:45]
 surface against those. Over in the part, great rule surface. We get a plan of surface against those. [0:02:53]
 It's not a solid. It's a surface. We can make that a solid by adding some offset and fill in that [0:03:00]
 offset if we want or we could have screwed it, rotate it, etc. Another way to create this is a non-planet [0:03:08]
 surface. And we're going to do a smooth sketch, come back over in the sketch. And create a sketch. [0:03:16]
 And we're going along the xz plane this time. And we'll do the same. We'll make an arc. [0:03:24]
 As long as it's single edge, it can be a b-smine, it can be an arc, it can be a straight edge. [0:03:30]
 So we've got that one there. We're creating another sketch. Do different planes. [0:03:37]
 I'm going to go for the xz plane again. And this time I'm going to use a straight line. [0:03:44]
 And we're bringing this across here. Something like that. We'll make the separation between these. [0:03:53]
 I could not want the sketch here. It's looking at the placement and coming into the position. [0:03:57]
 In here, we'll just move it along the y-axis. So this one here. And we'll move that along something like [0:04:06]
 60mm there. And again, it's the same process coming to the part. [0:04:13]
 So that one controls like the other. All happen is a surface will be created between these. [0:04:20]
 Click the rule surface and click it from the toolbar. And we get that rule surface. You can see the [0:04:26]
 change that's happened. So we've got a rule surface. Let's go from an arc to a straight edge. [0:04:34]
 Now we can continue with this surface if we wanted to. And let these two edges. So it's not just [0:04:42]
 sketches. We'll create a surface against that. And we can continue with the other side as well [0:04:50]
 and close this up by taking a save. We could take the original arc again. [0:04:54]
 And the rule surface or the surface that's just been created and create the rule surface again. [0:05:01]
 So long as it's one single edge with fine. As coming into the rule surface because our other [0:05:08]
 rule surface has disappeared. Coming into this one and Brussels space part. So we've got that there. [0:05:16]
 So now we've got a number of rule surfaces. We can make that as a solid. What we need to do is [0:05:22]
 control slets all of the surfaces. So we've got them all selected there. Now we can come up to part [0:05:30]
 compound. Make compound. Get compound which is the collection of those rule surfaces. Then part [0:05:38]
 convert to solid. We hide the compounds we no longer need that. And now we have a compounded solid. [0:05:46]
 And we can check that this is the solid by placing say a three on there. And I'm going to [0:05:54]
 slip the one I want to keep one I want to remove and do a cut. And you can see that's cut in there. [0:06:02]
 So now we've had to look at the rule surface. Let's have a look at the surface in tools for the [0:06:08]
 fill in. So we have free capital starting a new document. I'm going to come over to the sketch up [0:06:13]
 and I'm going to start sketching in here. So I'm going to start with a new sketch along the xyplane. [0:06:21]
 I'm going to sketch half an oval in here. And there is a reason for this. And that is because I want [0:06:32]
 two edges to create our surface in across. For this we're going to be using the arc of a lips. [0:06:40]
 So it's a bit interesting how it's tool is used. We've got the order constraints on and the void [0:06:45]
 run under constraints. And there's a number of inputs that you we require. First of all we can [0:06:50]
 strain the middle. So we get the arc there. Next we set the radius of the arc or the [0:07:00]
 the diameter of the arc. So I'm going to go back here. Next and this is where the arc is going to [0:07:08]
 start. We're going to come out and decide where the arc is going to start now. So about here. [0:07:17]
 And then we start draw the arc so we can start drawing it up now. And I want to alter constraint [0:07:26]
 to those lines. Once you get it down then you can actually move this about. So if here's [0:07:31]
 a scope we've got these controls that allows us to move this arc about. So we can [0:07:37]
 skew it as of such. I tend to take this point and this line and use the point on line constraint. [0:07:46]
 So it's constrained to there. And then I can control all the rest increasing that there and I can control [0:07:53]
 the arc this way as well and decide what type of shape I want. So I'm going to go for something [0:08:03]
 like that. I'm also going to do the inside of here as well. So I'm going to use the same tool. [0:08:09]
 So auto constraint to the center. Since major radius. So something about here coming over and this [0:08:19]
 is where we want to start this. So I'm going to come in to perhaps somewhere like here. [0:08:25]
 And then we start drawing the arc. No, it's constraining to that line. So we've got that arc in play now. [0:08:33]
 And remember that we've got these control points. The other control points you can see there. [0:08:40]
 It's nicely sitting on that line. So use that point and this line and place a point on line constraint. [0:08:47]
 Like so. And we can control what this is going to look like. So I'm looking for basically a [0:08:55]
 out wall and inner wall. And now going to use the line tool to connect up this point and this point [0:09:03]
 we're going to redundant constraints. So we just click on it and delete that constraint. [0:09:08]
 And we need to do the same for the other one as well. And this will go into redundant constraints. [0:09:14]
 This point. And this point trying to get rid of that horizontal line. So it's just a [0:09:21]
 quince of constraint there, which I'm just pushing down on the mouse or the touchpad. And you can see [0:09:29]
 that constraint is being removed. So we've got that there. So we don't have to roll it about [0:09:34]
 redundant constraints. To constrain these where we use these lines here. So we can use a length in here. [0:09:42]
 One for two. And we also use the height as well. So using this as a height. That constraints are [0:09:53]
 out of line. So I see there. So that's how you constrain these arcs. And we can do the other one. [0:10:02]
 But I'm just going to leave that one as it is. It's not fully constrained. I know that [0:10:06]
 not good practice, but we'll come out there. Just for speed. So we've got sketched down. [0:10:12]
 I want to create another sketch that runs up here. Now with this sketch it's that to you what you [0:10:20]
 want to do. We could copy this and rotate it. So we get the same shape or we could use to [0:10:26]
 totally different shape. I'm going to use an arc. So I'm going to come to the front and I'm going to use [0:10:32]
 a standard arc and create a new sketch. And make sure nothing is selected because we don't want [0:10:39]
 to attach. We want this to run straight through the middle of this object. And we want the xZ plane [0:10:45]
 and here. Okay. We can write for the center. And I'm going to pause it and jump into it. I'm going [0:10:52]
 to pull in these points on here and this point as well. Actually, pull in that line there. [0:11:01]
 Okay. I'll get the two points. That's fine. I'm going to use an endpoint to run point out for this one. [0:11:07]
 And I'm going to connect up these two points here and just place an arc. [0:11:14]
 And this one and this one will sort out the dimensions and everything in the moment and the [0:11:22]
 placement. So we've got those two arcs in there. The points are placed on this line or near to this line. [0:11:29]
 So we can see if I move this off. We haven't got that quincident to these two points. I'm going [0:11:34]
 to take those two, I'm going to take that quincident. That means that more than two faces and I had [0:11:40]
 this one selected. This line. So I'll take those two. Let's run there. [0:11:48]
 And we can see that moves up and down. Which is fine. And we've got this one here. We should just [0:11:58]
 move up and down. Which it does. And we can position those and set redesses. Or you can just take these two [0:12:04]
 points and set a height between those. 10 mil. So they will keep 10 mil together and we can decide [0:12:18]
 where this is going to sit. So you can go for something like that for click on the front. You can see [0:12:23]
 what's happening there. And we move this up until we get the desired effect. So maybe something [0:12:31]
 like that. I can set radius or even length between here. So we could go for the radius. [0:12:39]
 Like the strains both of them there. So one, one, five. And hit close. So we've got these now. [0:12:47]
 I'm going to strude in part work inch. The first sketch we did this one here. [0:12:55]
 So I'm going to strude that. Now this is going to be a closed top. So rather than [0:13:03]
 extruding upwards, I'm going to do the reverse. So click the reverse and I'll get send it around about [0:13:10]
 five millimeters. Downwards and hit OK. That's created that there. And now what I'm going to do [0:13:18]
 is mirror this is strude to the other side. So I'm going to click on the strude and use the mirror tool [0:13:26]
 or part mirroring. Now we're looking at the claim where we want to mirror this across. So I'm going [0:13:33]
 to come around and basically I want to flip this over to this side. So mirroring across this plane [0:13:41]
 here, which is the z with the x z plane. So you can see I want to mirror this way over here and the [0:13:51]
 x z plane there. So let's change this to x z and here OK. Now I've got that over the other side. [0:14:00]
 And now we can start surfacing this. So to do the surfacing, we need to be in the surface workbench. [0:14:07]
 So one option is to use the surface workbench to do this. So this comes over to the surface workbench [0:14:12]
 by dropping down and looking for the surface on there. I'm going to be using this tool here [0:14:20]
 the fill-in tool to use it. We click on it and start adding edges. Now I'm going to work from the inside [0:14:28]
 because we can see the inside much easier as we start surfaced this. So first we're going to add an edge. [0:14:35]
 Now I'm going to click on this edge here of the strude. Now this is a reason why we mirror this [0:14:43]
 because we need enough edge. If this was one single oval then it will be one edge running around this. [0:14:50]
 And we can select another one. So that's add another edge and that's that the inner edge here. [0:14:58]
 So we closed that surface because we look over to the model. You see a surface is being created. [0:15:04]
 But this is just a flat surface. We need it to conform to this arc here. And this is the reason why [0:15:12]
 I've added these arcs. To do that, I scroll down and we see the edge constraints. So we first [0:15:19]
 on the boundaries, click on the edge constraints and look at the non-boundary edges. So these will [0:15:26]
 constrain the surface. So we add an edge and click this inner arc. You can see by adding that [0:15:37]
 constraint on that surface it's full surface to pass through that arc. Now I'm completely [0:15:44]
 that. Let's hit OK and we'll work on the next surface, the outer surface. So again we use the [0:15:52]
 fill in. We add an edge, click the outside edge and then click the upper edge, come down to the edge [0:16:04]
 constraints, click add an edge and then click the top. So now we create it a surface between those. [0:16:16]
 That's it OK and see what's happened. We've got two surfaces and in it an outer surface. [0:16:24]
 Let's bring this around to have a look at the bottom and I'm going to hide the astrude [0:16:30]
 and the other astrude will be inside that mirror. You can see we've got two surfaces sitting in there [0:16:40]
 but we don't have closure between these. So we were going to close this, we would need an edge [0:16:49]
 that run across here if we wanted to close between the inner and outer surfaces because if we tried [0:16:55]
 to do that with the fill in then we add an edge, click one, click the other, you can see that there's [0:17:04]
 nothing happened. It hasn't filled in there, we haven't got any edge to last to fill that. We can see [0:17:13]
 the boundary edges must be added in conceptive order. Even if we move those edges, let's remove them, [0:17:22]
 nice too, as an edge and work our way around. We can see that hasn't worked. So what do we do? [0:17:35]
 Well we use a different tool. Well we can create a line that goes across here. Or we can come over to the [0:17:43]
 part and create a ruled surface. So we click on the two edges like so, control clicking them. [0:17:51]
 And then click ruled surface and that creates a surface between those. I still on the other side, [0:18:00]
 click one, control click the other, you can't find rule surface, it's in part, then create rule [0:18:08]
 surface and it creates a surface across those like so. So now we've got rule surfaces and inside [0:18:15]
 that we've got the surfaces that make up our object. These will be the same. So if I click on this one, [0:18:24]
 you'll see that the top one will disappear as well. So we have our shape and we have our struts [0:18:36]
 needs to here, which I want because I want this type of shape here. We can't do anything with [0:18:45]
 these at the moment because they need to be joined together. If I come into the ruled surfaces [0:18:51]
 and open these up, you see we've got the surface and surface 0, 0, 1 and the two ruled surfaces. [0:18:59]
 We've got create a compound of these to keep them all together. To do that, we can I've [0:19:06]
 set them from the tree view or what I prefer is actually selecting them from the screen. So [0:19:13]
 we first click our ruled surface or which ever surface you come to, I can see my strut as appeared [0:19:21]
 there so I'm going to click on this strut and press the space bar just to hide those out the way. [0:19:25]
 So I can see the ruled surface underneath. So I'm going to join all those surfaces up so I'm going [0:19:32]
 to take one ruled surface and the other and then take the inner. I'm holding them the control key [0:19:38]
 as I click these and then I'm just going to rotate around the other side. I've got my finger off [0:19:43]
 the control key and I can move this about. This still selected and then I'll get hold around control [0:19:50]
 game and click the other one. So we've got all those selected. We now make a compound. Come up to part [0:19:58]
 and select compound and then make compound. We've got one single compound object there. [0:20:07]
 Which has all those surfaces within. This isn't a solid yet. So if I add it say a balling here [0:20:18]
 or sphere and make the radius say about 20 and transform this. So it actually intersects this. [0:20:32]
 And that's bringing out the other side like so. Okay. And then take the compound and sphere. [0:20:40]
 If I try to boolean those together with the union, you'll say that we've got a non-solid object [0:20:46]
 in there and boolean results. Make calls and issue and if I yes you can see the fusion [0:20:52]
 has calls and issue. That's to delete that. So we've got to convert that compound to a solid. That's [0:21:01]
 quite easy to do. So click on the compound. Come up to part and come down to convert to solid. [0:21:07]
 We'll click that. The compound will be kept and there'll be a new compound solid object underneath. [0:21:13]
 So this is a solid object of that compound. That's hide the original compound. [0:21:18]
 Now we're warning this is non-parametric. So if I change the original, this one won't change. [0:21:27]
 If you do want a parametric copy, then I would advise coming over to the Curse Workbench. [0:21:34]
 So you would have to install the Curse Workbench to allow for this. That can be installed from [0:21:40]
 Tools Adel Manager. It is a more advanced Workbench, but it allows you some extra tools [0:21:47]
 and in here. You can go through exactly the same process. But we've got this tool here parametric [0:21:54]
 solid. So if I hide that original solid and come into the compound, show that and use [0:22:04]
 a parametric solid there. It creates a solid, but it still, as you can see, [0:22:11]
 related to the faces of that compound. So if that compound changes, so we'll this solid. [0:22:19]
 Then we create a solid's E-supant that you would do last of all. But now we have [0:22:26]
 that solid. Well that's take the original solid here and come back to the part workbench. [0:22:33]
 We can see that this is a solid just by clicking on one wall to keep. And this time, [0:22:40]
 let's go for a removal. So control click the one I want to keep, control click the sphere, [0:22:45]
 one wall to remove and use a cut. And that's cut into there. So that is a solid there. [0:22:56]
 And that's a basic introduction to a surface in workflow that you would use. It's a [0:23:05]
 create something like this type of object. In our next video, we're going to be looking at [0:23:10]
 loss. We'll be lifting from one sketch to another. To allow us to create more geometry on top. [0:23:16]
 Such as this model here. This is a rule loft. We'll be looking at more conventional loss, [0:23:24]
 such as this boat shape here. And learn how to loft to a point. And the problems that we may [0:23:30]
 find when following that workflow. And we're going to solve them by using elements from the [0:23:35]
 surface workflow that we learned today. So I hope you've been enjoying these videos. I hope to see you [0:23:40]
