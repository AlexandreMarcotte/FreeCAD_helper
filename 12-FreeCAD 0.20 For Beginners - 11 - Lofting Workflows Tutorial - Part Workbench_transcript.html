===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 11 - Lofting Workflows Tutorial - Part Workbench =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back. We're on episode 11 of the Learning FreeCAD for Beginners. We'll teach you the fundamentals of freecad from a beginner's perspective. [0:00:09]
 While we understand the multiple workflows in freecad, [0:00:12]
 in today's tutorial we're going to be exploring lofts. We're going to be using the part workbench. [0:00:17]
 We're going to be using the loft function in there. The reason why we're using the part workbench is because it allows for open and closed geometry for our lofting. [0:00:27]
 Concepts that will be teaching in the part workbench can be applied to the part design as well as [0:00:32]
 long as we're using closed sketches. We're going to start off with some closed geometry, [0:00:38]
 and learn how to loft through a number of circles and understand the concepts of lofting. [0:00:43]
 Later we'll move on to some open geometry and then stand where we actually use that and how to close [0:00:49]
 it up into a solid. Both these concepts will be used with something called a loft to a point, [0:00:55]
 often used when we're creating boats or something that needs to terminate not our profile [0:01:02]
 but our vertex. We're going to be understanding how we use uniform and non-uniform profiles in our [0:01:08]
 loft and how we need to be aware of the edges that are created and how to line those edges up [0:01:14]
 with the different profiles that we use. Also, I'm going to be offering up some tips on lofting, [0:01:19]
 including a way of guiding your lofts using a skeleton sketch. So that's a continue around [0:01:25]
 journey and learn about this feature. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have [0:01:31]

 span the channel. So before we delve into the model we're going to first understand what a loft is. [0:01:56]
 I'm in the sketcher and I'm going to create a number of sketches in here and I'm going to add [0:02:01]
 something called a profile here so the profile will be a cross section of the object. I want the [0:02:07]
 X airplane. I'm here okay. For the time being I'm just going to create a number of sketches with [0:02:14]
 circles in them. This will be our profile. For close that we've got this circle here and I'm going [0:02:24]
 to duplicate this sketch multiple times come out to edit, duplicate selection or using the control [0:02:32]
 C and the control V shortcut on the keyboard. We have three sketches. I'm going to separate them [0:02:41]
 with the placement to add a bit of distance between them. Using the position and using the [0:02:50]
 Y axis. So 50 and this one can be 100. So we separate those out. Let's make these sketch a bit more [0:03:03]
 varied. I will take this one and make this smaller. So we've got three different size sketches. [0:03:15]
 Now if you think of this as a curve surface this will be the cross sections. So when we loft [0:03:20]
 what will happen is freakhead will fill in material between these and curve these or create a straight [0:03:30]
 surface between these known as a rod. So a rod will be straight and the wall off will be curved. [0:03:37]
 To do that I'm going to use the part. We're going to be using the part designing in the moment to [0:03:42]
 do loss as well. Now in the part I can come into the part loft and I can start adding the profiles. [0:03:51]
 Remember these sketches are profiles. These have to be an order. Let's show you what happens with just [0:03:58]
 using two profiles. So I'm going to select the sketch which is highlighting the one on left here [0:04:03]
 and then I've got to bring in the next sketch. This one here and use a right button. [0:04:09]
 You can see we've got great solid, rod surface and closed. If I click create solid this will be a solid. [0:04:18]
 If I leave it as it is it'll be a shell. If I hit OK we have now got this face here. [0:04:26]
 As you can see we've just gone from one profile to the other and it's filled in the material in the [0:04:34]
 middle. Now this surface is actually rolled because it's just on straight from profile 8 to profile b. [0:04:42]
 And if we look it from side we can see it's just a straight line going from one to the other. [0:04:48]
 Let's bring in this sketch now. To do that I can delete loft or can come into the loft [0:04:56]
 and look down on the data tab and look down on the bottom and we see sections. [0:05:01]
 So you can see sketch sketch series 0 1 and if I click we get the button at the end where we can add more. [0:05:09]
 In the link we just click on sketch 2. It highlights when we roll over it and hit OK. [0:05:19]
 Doesn't look like anything's happened. We can see there's a tick by the loft. [0:05:24]
 We click on the screen you can see that's lofted all away. So this profile. [0:05:31]
 Now if we look from the side we have more curvature across here. [0:05:37]
 That can be controlled to some degree by the max degrees at the moment it's 5 and we can set that to 2. [0:05:45]
 And the more profiles we have the more this comes into play. So that's how to view more profiles to this. [0:05:54]
 So I'm going to come and just loft and just copy this last profile. You can control see and control v [0:06:00]
 and copy a couple of times. So that's sketch. Go into the placement, go into the position [0:06:07]
 and set this 250 and set this one 25. We're now add those to the loft. [0:06:20]
 I can add to the loft. Have a look at the sections. Click in the bottom of the end and just click [0:06:28]
 3 and 4 and hit OK. Click off. I can see how we've lofted through those. [0:06:36]
 Click on this loft. Go this max degree here. Bring this up and what I'm just just hit the [0:06:46]
 shortcut for refresh and you can see if I use the down arrow and using the shortcut for refresh [0:06:53]
 on Ubuntu so that's control r. You can see how a has effect on that surface. So I mean [0:07:00]
 increasing it and decreasing it and you can see that surface moving. [0:07:09]
 As said at the moment we've just got a horror object to make this solid we just use the loft. [0:07:18]
 Go into the solid and set this to true. So that is solid now. [0:07:25]
 If I use the rule set that to true you can see the effect that we have. So we have a straight loft [0:07:38]
 between each of the profiles. We can also loft to a point. So that's add a point in here. [0:07:45]
 For that I'm going to use a sketch in the sketcher. [0:07:49]
 Create a new sketch. A little same plane. The xo plane and here I'll [0:07:56]
 OK. And I'm going to use the point. Create point which is going to add a point. I'm just going [0:08:05]
 to add it to this line for the time being. So you can see this point didn't hear. I'll just hit [0:08:09]
 a sketch get a mouse pointed back. This one's show up because this needs to be converted. [0:08:15]
 Out of construction mode. So points are construction geometry. [0:08:19]
 If I click on it and select sketch sketch geometries and come into toggle construction [0:08:28]
 geometry that turns white now. That's no longer construction geometry. I'm just going to move this [0:08:35]
 up to the center and go to the model. Click on this sketch. Come down to the placement [0:08:45]
 and the position. I'm going to move this into place. So we're moving it along the y axis. [0:08:51]
 Now we can see that sketch is moving forward and I want that point. I say just in front here. [0:09:03]
 Now I've got that sketch. Let's come over to our main view and add this to the [0:09:14]
 loft. Click on the loft. Come down and we see the sections. Click on this up and select [0:09:22]
 that last sketch and hit OK. But click off now. You see we've lofted to the point. We still [0:09:28]
 in-road mode. So I click on it. Come into the loft. I'm going to the [0:09:34]
 road. I set that to fulls. We will get a curve on the end of that. We have to be careful with [0:09:44]
 loft into a point. When we do in sketches that are not 360 degrees. So we're going to demonstrate [0:09:50]
 that problem next and how to resolve that. And also I'm going to show you a few tips that I've [0:09:54]
 learned in the past of how to position profiles quickly and easily. So they allow for more [0:09:59]
 flexibility in customizing their positions. So I'm going to create a number of sketches on here. [0:10:05]
 But I'm going to use a different technique to create these sketches. Before you saw me create these [0:10:10]
 sketches and I move them along a plane. I'm going to use some guidance geometry now. [0:10:16]
 First of all I'm going to create a sketch for the guide. I can place it along the x y plane. [0:10:22]
 Okay. Now this one will be lofted. This is just going to be a guide. [0:10:27]
 I'm going to use a polyline to create a line that I can attach the profiles to. [0:10:36]
 So I just add them along here. Like so. Here's a scape and we're to leave the redundant constraints. [0:10:46]
 So those redundant constraints are gone now. The thing is that I have this polyline. [0:10:57]
 So I can move this into position and decide where this is going to start, where this is going to [0:11:03]
 end. I've placed it through the center and may want to start at this point. And I can set [0:11:09]
 lengths in here. So I can create distance between the points at exact amounts. [0:11:15]
 So 50 and this one I'm going to put 50 as well at 25. So we've got this in here. If I close, [0:11:31]
 all happen is we'll get a line with a number of vertices across there. [0:11:35]
 Now I'll just have come into the view and click on this sketch and find in the point [0:11:44]
 size. So coming down you'll find the point size here and up in that point size to something larger. [0:11:50]
 That means we can easily select these points. Now what I'm going to do is attach sketches to [0:11:58]
 these points that run this way. So we're going to create a sketch and these are going to be our profiles. [0:12:05]
 Now it doesn't matter where we place these. If I hit OK on the xy plane, I'm going to come out [0:12:11]
 to the model and hide that sketch. I can create a simple boat shape. So I'm going to start with an [0:12:18]
 arc. So this is the first thing I'm going to start in here with. I'm going to add this in. [0:12:24]
 So there we are. Here I should use the end point of room point arc and what can do is just [0:12:33]
 attach that to this line. Put in a line constraint. And we're going to make a simple [0:12:39]
 shape with arcs first. And we're going to use a half shape and I'm going to show you the [0:12:44]
 problems we're going to have with the point. So that's in there and what we're going to do is just [0:12:51]
 set horizontal and the constraint in there. So I've got my sketch come in and close up. [0:12:58]
 At the moment it's on the same plane as this other sketch here. I'm also as a bit big so that's [0:13:06]
 bringing this down to the size something like something like that and close that. [0:13:12]
 Which is going for a simple half moon shape to start with and then we're going to start adding [0:13:18]
 edges and showing you other things to deal with loss of fruit. I'm going to attach this sketch [0:13:25]
 to this line. To do that I'm going to take the sketch, the profile and come into the data tab [0:13:32]
 and have a look at the support and map mode. At the moment the support has nothing there. The [0:13:38]
 map mode is deaffated. Use the button on the end when you click on this field, this button appears [0:13:44]
 and we select button. It's now asking us a reference for this sketch. So this is where it's going [0:13:51]
 to be attached. Make sure selecting is being shown here if not just click on reference one or [0:13:59]
 whiffers in here and then come over and select this vertex. So this one on the end. [0:14:05]
 All happen the sketch will move. So the middle of this will translate to that vertex. [0:14:13]
 Next select reference two and select this line between these two vertices. [0:14:21]
 Click that. It's going to ask you for the way you want to attach it. [0:14:27]
 Now if you say normer to edge this means it's going to go along this edge this way. [0:14:33]
 So click normer to edge and what we have is that sketch is now attached. I'm going to go outside [0:14:40]
 down here's the top. That's the right way. It's attached to that line. [0:14:45]
 And we can do the same once I okay that I can copy this sketch. Come out to edit. [0:14:53]
 Okay it's going to ask us about the other dependencies that has because it has to [0:14:59]
 dependency on the other sketch because it's attached to it. Then it's going to ask you if you want to copy it. [0:15:04]
 Just uncheck that sketch there and hit OK. We got a copy of it and we do the same click on that [0:15:13]
 sketch. That mode is normal to edge. So let's click on these three points because it's going to [0:15:19]
 be selected against the same vertex. So you can see the same vertex is here. Let's click on that [0:15:24]
 vertex. Change the vertex. Now it's here and must remember to change the edges as well. [0:15:31]
 So that one there. This matters this edge. In this one it doesn't matter too much but if you have a curve [0:15:39]
 then it will matter because we need to follow like curve. [0:15:43]
 Let's hit OK and let's do the other one. This time I'm going to go up to edit and copy [0:15:52]
 and remove this sketch here. So I got sketch 2 and hit OK. The reason why I did that is because [0:16:02]
 I can now paste this a number of times. It's a control v. So that's this one control v again and [0:16:10]
 that's this one. Therefore it doesn't ask me about attachments. He's still in the clipboard. I can [0:16:15]
 paste it as many times as I want. We want the third sketch, map mode. Set the vertex this one [0:16:24]
 and line, select in this one. OK and last of all this one. Set coming to the map mode [0:16:36]
 works. First one we need select the vertex. Mr vertex is trying to gain [0:16:46]
 select in still. Let's try it that one. And line this one. As a word select that again. [0:16:54]
 This vertex got a bit of a problem. That's to leave these out. Oh no it's because I've got [0:17:02]
 an old edge. So I click an old edge. There we go. That's in there now. [0:17:07]
 And line should be this one in front. So that one there. Sketch edge for here. OK. So now we've [0:17:16]
 added all those profiles on there. We're going to adjust these profiles. But the thing is, [0:17:22]
 you said if we come back to this original sketch this one here and adjust any of these or move this [0:17:28]
 so up here then this will move. And we're going to adjust. So this one. [0:17:39]
 It's 25 and here. OK and here close and that's become nearer to there. So that was [0:17:50]
 just some adjustments in there. It's quite quick. And we can place this in folders or [0:17:56]
 even come in and come down and look at the constraints. So we've got the constraints in here. [0:18:03]
 If we named these constraints on this one, this sketch, our walled lines in, we come down here. [0:18:13]
 This is better. We've got all the constraints here. So you can see the individual constraints. [0:18:16]
 We've got 25 and 25. And we can name these if we want, but we can just edit these in here. So [0:18:22]
 this 25 and I'll insert 50 from here enter and you can see that's moved over here. [0:18:27]
 But that's set this one to 50. Now we go move that one out and we can move this up and use the [0:18:37]
 refresh and down and just make it a lot easier to move these profiles about. I said it's some of these [0:18:44]
 profiles. So let's take this one and make this a bit smaller. And I've got these fully constrained. [0:18:55]
 So making my life a bit harder. So something like there we go. So I like that. [0:19:06]
 And this one, let's move this one in. So we've got something like this. Now when I [0:19:22]
 loft through these, we'll get half a shape. So go into the part and use the loft. So we can use [0:19:29]
 it from the toolbar here, this loft feature. And we can add the mean. So don't want to add this sketch. [0:19:35]
 We want to add this one. Next one, this one. And this one and we'll press solid and here. Okay. [0:19:43]
 So let's loft it all away through there. It's not exactly a boat shape because [0:19:50]
 well we haven't created the profiles right. Really we need to edges in here to allow for that. [0:19:57]
 But we'll do that in a moment. Now if I created a vertex, so that's great another sketch over in [0:20:08]
 the sketcher. Great another sketch on the YZ plane. So at the moment that's sitting there, [0:20:18]
 I'm going to move this so it's in front in the placement. Come down and we'll want to come into the [0:20:26]
 position. We'll go on the X. And we'll just move this with a page up and page down. So [0:20:33]
 page down and we'll just place it around there. We're going to get some more results. So if I [0:20:40]
 had the point in here like so. And we'll make sure that is construction geometry. So click on it. [0:20:51]
 Make sure it's sletted and turn it to construction geometry. So now what we should have is a point [0:20:59]
 that sits just in front of here so you can see that just there. That's hide this. [0:21:06]
 It's basically on the one. So let's add that to the loft. So come into the loft come into the data. [0:21:12]
 Come down to the sections. Click on that and add that sketch. And okay. And click off you can see what's [0:21:23]
 happening now. So add in that point as created a number of faces and a number of edges. [0:21:30]
 The way to solve this is quite easy rather than using a closed sketch and this works in the part. [0:21:37]
 If I come into the sketches, we'll use an open one. So I'm going to delete the top. [0:21:43]
 So we just got this curve. This will go into error until I finish the more because we can't mix [0:21:51]
 open and close profile. So this is an open profile. It's an open sketch. And you'll notice once I've [0:21:58]
 finished this, it will resolve. And it closed. Now we've got this shape and you can see that we haven't [0:22:13]
 got any problems. At the moment I've still got it set to close so it's still got back. So that's [0:22:21]
 fine. So I've still got it set to solid. Let's still got it back. So it closes the back there. [0:22:27]
 I need to, if I wanted this, say a solid at the moment, well it's just a surface where we were [0:22:35]
 back or a shell. And you see we haven't even got an edge on this one. So we can't actually use this. [0:22:42]
 So go to the loft and set the solid to false. Then we've got that there. So we've got this edge here [0:22:52]
 and this edge running along this way and this edge running along this way. So remember back to our [0:23:00]
 previous tutorial, what do we do? We'll come over to say the part what we've been and we'll use this edge [0:23:09]
 and control click the upper edge and remember rule surface. Going to part come down to [0:23:18]
 crow rule surface, create rule surface across those and then we can do the same in here. So this curve [0:23:28]
 and this edge and to use the rule surface. It's time to use a toolbar and close that up and then we can [0:23:38]
 compound this up. We're like control click in on the surfaces like so, part compound, make compound [0:23:51]
 and then use that compound, kind of part convert to solid. Hide the compound and now we have [0:23:59]
 a solid. This one here. Make sure that everything inside is hidden more sketches on here and so we can [0:24:07]
 get rid of the loads as well as highlight those in press and spacebar and just hide them and this one. [0:24:13]
 So we've got this pear shapes object here which is a solid and we know that's a solid because [0:24:21]
 we can do Boolean operations against those. So we're set to 50 and I'll take that sphere right click [0:24:30]
 transform and move this into here and hit OK one order to keep the one order to remove and we're [0:24:38]
 Boolean that out like so let's take a chunk out there. So straight away we can make complex shapes [0:24:46]
 with loss using that technique. Let's have a look when we start to add edges. So this is when we [0:24:55]
 have a profile that's made up of more than one edge. So this time we're going to look at profiles [0:25:03]
 that have more to work with. So create a new sketch, long the except plane and here OK. I'm going to [0:25:10]
 create a circle here which has one edge and then I'm going to create a new sketch which you're [0:25:19]
 on nothing slated. It's done here attacher, x said OK and I'm going to create a square. [0:25:27]
 So what we've got is one shape with one edge and one shape with four edges. [0:25:34]
 Now hit close. We need some distance away from these two. I'm going to go along the y axis [0:25:43]
 and I'm just going to move this one out. So we can loft between those. If we add these at an [0:25:51]
 angle as well we can also do that. So I'll take this one and change the angle to something like that [0:25:57]
 and we'll move it down along the z axis. [0:26:04]
 We can loft between those. We're going to get a walled surface between those but that's fine [0:26:16]
 as you better for our demonstration. Go to the part and we're going to use the part loft [0:26:23]
 and I'm going to add both those sketches and make a solid. [0:26:29]
 Now watch what happens. I hit OK. We've got one, two, three, four, five edges. Now why is that? [0:26:45]
 We'll look where the edges are set. Then if I hide that loft see this vertex here [0:26:53]
 on this circle you'll notice that an edge connects that to a projected vertex on this square [0:27:04]
 and it's the same for the others because we haven't got a vertex to match that up with. [0:27:12]
 Then we have to project the vertex across here. So we will have one edge and four edges [0:27:20]
 but one can go to loft and hide those sketches. We will have this vertex. [0:27:29]
 That walled for our profile to the same position as it would be on the circle here and our edges [0:27:37]
 divide up. Now if I change this sketch so this sketch here and we'll use the split and tool [0:27:48]
 which is a brilliant tool over in the geometries and split edge. It's also available for [0:27:56]
 the toolbar here and what we're going to do is split this by redefine out where [0:28:02]
 that's just drop that tool by right-clicking and come into this sketch process space bar. [0:28:09]
 I need to find out where the vertices are on this sketch so it's one in this corner. [0:28:16]
 So we'll split here and it's one here so split here one here. Now remember we've got [0:28:27]
 a vertex around here somewhere as well. We haven't because we're splitting so that's fine. [0:28:34]
 The vertex will be faded if this was a single circle which is creating the four edges. [0:28:40]
 Now so there's four edges in this sketch like so and what you'll see is these edges will now [0:28:47]
 match up so we'll have four edges rather than five. Right-click and that's come out of the sketch [0:28:57]
 and have a look to see what we've got. Notice how the edges match up to the edges we've added [0:29:05]
 to this circle. A much cleaner loft and you have to be careful of this because [0:29:12]
 what can happen is that if we weren't back to this sketch and move this edge across here and this [0:29:22]
 one up here we will start to get twisting with this as close as up. [0:29:27]
 You can put a good string and close and you can see how that's twisted there. [0:29:35]
 I mean you can use this to your advantage but this can be a bit of a problem when you're [0:29:42]
 creating curves and you're trying to get a nice clean surface you have to be careful of this [0:29:49]
 twisting so it's a good idea to line up the vertices and keep in mind how we model as you're [0:29:56]
 creating them. So here's another tip for the loft into a point I have this boat shape here and [0:30:02]
 this is built in the part workbench. A fusion these two together because I've used a mirror [0:30:09]
 so I've only done one side so I've done this side and delete that mirror we've got this loft here [0:30:16]
 and it goes to a point and you can see it's a solid inside you'll only see the sketches we've [0:30:22]
 got no surface in and here so I've managed to create a loft to a point and you see all the edges are [0:30:30]
 marion up so we'll look at the vertices on these sketches if I bring these sketches into [0:30:35]
 existence by pressing the space bar so you can see now the quicker that sketch we've got [0:30:41]
 a line that's tangent to an arc and then we've closed the sketch with these two lines here we're [0:30:47]
 not fully constrained but that's fine. When I add some angle to it you can see that all these edges [0:30:53]
 are in line and you'll notice we've got a little profile at the front and this is where the magic [0:31:00]
 is so we follow all these points and basically draw a line between them we end up if I zoom into [0:31:09]
 this last profile you'll see that we've got the same numbers of edges as the other profiles we've [0:31:15]
 just got a really small profile which is a copy of this one and I'll just shrunk it right down [0:31:22]
 in size and you can see that if I double click on this sketch you can see how much smaller that [0:31:30]
 is to all the rest and this brings this to a point so if I zoom into that profile you'll see [0:31:39]
 a little tiny edge there so we can get away with that we can make this smaller even more but if we [0:31:48]
 come into some light-free-deprinting then this probably will just come to a point anyway if it's that's [0:31:54]
 small so that's one way of doing that we save time we've actually modeling by just creating one side [0:32:02]
 and all I do with this loft is come up to the part mirroring and we're going to mirror it over the [0:32:09]
 plane bring this around so we're going to be mirroring it over here we mirroring over the [0:32:15]
 YZ plane so we're mirroring over this line here this way so we can drop this down towards that plane [0:32:22]
 and here okay now we've got our loft inside the mirror so these two are available [0:32:33]
 to fusion together and to do that we just click one control click the other so we've got [0:32:41]
 drilled into this mirror I spent out see that loft in there and we union those together [0:32:45]
 so we've got fusion now for coming to the original loft which is down here what we don't have to [0:32:52]
 do that we have to come into this loft these are both the same so you have a loft within [0:32:58]
 loft mirror and this loft here for click on this one press the spacebar you can see they are linked [0:33:04]
 it's just the processes that this loft mirror has gone through to get to there [0:33:10]
 so for coming to the loft we can see those sketches in there if I click one shift click last one [0:33:18]
 press the spacebar we get rid of those sketches and we can see we've got the boat shape there [0:33:24]
 so carrying on from this video what we're going to do is look at the part design lofts [0:33:31]
 so we're going to create this object I'm going to spend this object out to make this [0:33:35]
 basically a video of all the techniques that we had before so we've got pads pockets, [0:33:40]
 revolves, bluffs and we might add some bruises and sweeps in there so we're viewing all [0:33:46]
 those but we're going to be doing it from a part design workflow so if we look at the part design [0:33:55]
 workflow this is a more linear structure and it's more easy to understand but it's quite limited [0:34:01]
 compared to what you can do in the parts it's just not cat processes part is much more flexible [0:34:09]
 and allows you to work in a more organic way you see as we work down we get this green icon here [0:34:15]
 the arrow pointing down was this is the last action if I come into this additive loft we can see [0:34:21]
 two sketches here and what I've done if I hide that I'll hidden the body in this hide this pocket [0:34:30]
 you can see I've added a sketch to the base and then add another sketch so it hovers above [0:34:38]
 and then we create a loft between these two with the additive loft because this only two [0:34:45]
 is going to create a rolled loft between those and then next video we'll actually build this from scratch [0:34:51]
 and add some extra features on here so we can get understand of how all these tools work together [0:34:58]
 in a part design workflow we've been concentrating more on parts in the next video we could be [0:35:04]
 concentrating on the part design to create this feature this can be created from the part as well [0:35:10]
 very similar workflow but we'll be using Boolean to actually place those together to union those together [0:35:17]
 in the part design it's done all for you because you're only allowed a single body object [0:35:24]
 so multi-body objects aren't allowed in the part design that means everything is fused together [0:35:29]
 so I hope you've enjoyed this video and I hope to see you in the next one [0:35:34]
