===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 12 - Parametric Modelling with Master Sketch, Formulas - Part Design =====
 I have one, and welcome back to another episode of the Learning FreeCount for Beginners, [0:00:04]
 we will teach the fundamentals of freecount in a practical way by learning different workflows [0:00:09]
 and how to apply them to your projects. In this episode we are going to be using a MasterSketch workflow [0:00:15]
 allowing us to change parts of this sketch to our data model to different dimensions. [0:00:23]
 Our model is fully parametric and this MasterSketch allows the loft, the revolve, and any additional [0:00:37]
 features that have been added to the model to reconfigure. Now we are continuing from the previous video [0:00:43]
 where we used lofty objects and we can be lofty in the part design and we are going to create this model. [0:00:49]
 Don't worry if you haven't watched that video, we are going to be taking you through the whole process in this video anyway. [0:00:55]
 We are going to be following a MasterSketch workflow, we are creating a MasterSketch [0:01:01]
 which we control in part design objects made with sketches and actions. [0:01:06]
 The dimensions of the sketches will be controlled by formulas or expressions which will be [0:01:13]
 referenced back to the original MasterSketch. Any changes in the MasterSketch will reflect [0:01:18]
 down to the underlying geometry and the model itself. So I hope you are enjoying this series, [0:01:24]
 hope you find it useful and that is how we look at this workflow. [0:01:27]

 For this tutorial we are going to freak out and create new document. I am going to be using the [0:01:57]
 part design. I am going to create a sketch. Now this sketch is going to be basically the roughing [0:02:07]
 out of the object. It is going to be our MasterSketch. We are going to be using that to transfer [0:02:13]
 sizes and dimensions to the actual model. So we are going to go along the exit plane not decided [0:02:20]
 I want to place it along there. I am looking at the profile of the model. I am going to use [0:02:28]
 some geometry here so we are going to be using a line for the base. This is going to be the base [0:02:35]
 this line here and we are going to place another line here. We are going to set some radius long [0:02:42]
 here. This will be our high we want the space, the thickness of the base and the hit scale [0:02:48]
 to get our mouse on the back and again. I am going to place some constraints in here. I am going to [0:02:54]
 place a length constraint and we are going to set this one to about 40 millimeters here. Okay and these [0:03:03]
 two are going to be equal. I set a height here and this is going to go out 6 millimeters and now [0:03:12]
 we want the height of our loft. I am going to use some geometry for that as well. So I am going to place [0:03:17]
 a line in here and set the length of that. So I am just roughing out the object. That means I [0:03:25]
 know I am at the right scale down here and set some height quickly. So about 70 millimeters [0:03:32]
 and it also gives me an idea of what the object is going to look like in a very rudimentary form. [0:03:37]
 I am going to have a circle here. This is going to be a sphere. I am going to use an [0:03:46]
 set the radius of this sphere as well. Set the radius and we will set that to 50 millimeters. [0:03:53]
 I am okay that. So what I am going to do is actually loft from this point two here and I am [0:04:01]
 saying with this one. So I need to figure out where I want the loft to actually stop. So I am going [0:04:10]
 to have it stop in in the middle here. I am going to place a line and this is going to be the size [0:04:16]
 wall the radius of this loft. So we are going to come out let's come out of this size so it is out of the [0:04:22]
 way and set a size in here and set this. This will be a length and we are going to say this is around [0:04:31]
 10 millimeters. So we are going to loft into this point. So a top section, a top profile will be [0:04:40]
 of a radius of 10 millimeters. Now I think that is all the geometry we need. [0:04:48]
 Actually we do need the arc. So I am going to add the extension to this base here. So we can come out [0:04:56]
 to about here. I have got over constrain this quickly, constrain and hit delete. Here it is going to [0:05:03]
 and set some length in here using the length and set this one to around about 15 millimeters. [0:05:10]
 I am not going to bother with this side but we have got all those in there. [0:05:15]
 That is bringing this down. Now what I am going to do is start name in leads. So each of these [0:05:21]
 constraints are going to have a name. Now allow me to reference from from the part design. [0:05:27]
 So I start from here. So this is going to be either base thickness. It is a common name and call it [0:05:36]
 base thickness. Notice that I have used an uppercase b in an uppercase t. This matters. [0:05:46]
 So when we are referencing these outside then we need to take an account of that. So we have done [0:05:51]
 that one. This one is going to be base profile radius. And then we have got this one here. [0:06:04]
 Top profile radius. And finally the sphere radius. So what I am going to do is recreate [0:06:20]
 this object in 3D. I am going to be working from the bottom up to first we will create [0:06:26]
 the profile of the revolve that goes in here and then we will start lifting up to the sphere. [0:06:33]
 As it closed and we have got our master sketch. That is name it. So I am going to rename [0:06:44]
 to master sketch. Now this master sketch will be the reference for all the geometry [0:06:52]
 and we can be using the formula field or the expression that is set to allow us to do this. [0:06:58]
 So let's create our first piece of geometry which is going to be our revolve. Make sure [0:07:04]
 nothing is selected and create a sketch. Now straight away we are going to use the master sketch [0:07:08]
 and see that we need to go along the x-z plane. My sketch is shown through and we can start [0:07:16]
 placing in our revolve. I am not going to actually pull in any of this geometry. So what I am going to [0:07:21]
 do is start adding in lines into this. So I am going to start creating two lines. So come in here [0:07:29]
 one and two like so. Now I attach my master sketch to this line. I am just going to use the [0:07:36]
 underneath this line for this. So I have placed that there because I want center. So here it does [0:07:48]
 not matter but we could have moved this up and done this. We have added that geometry there [0:07:53]
 and I am going to add a length in here. So this one here. So we are going to have a constraints [0:08:00]
 click, we are going to have a constraint and hit delete and start getting some lengths in here. [0:08:05]
 So we are going to use the height first and click on this one. Now we are coming to this button [0:08:11]
 at the end which is the expression editor. Click on it and we start typing in the name of sketch [0:08:16]
 name. We were renamed it so we start typing in the capital at M. A.S. And we got master sketch there. [0:08:24]
 So click on that we can see there is a dot added. That is important. That means I can start typing [0:08:31]
 up a case C. Oh and we get the constraints click that and hit a dot. Now this is where we have to [0:08:40]
 remember what we call them. So I know this is called face thickness of 6 millimeters and hit okay. [0:08:50]
 If I hit okay now what happened is if I hit a skate to get a mouse point back the height will be added. [0:08:58]
 It's in orange that means that it's a sternal geometry that this is referencing. [0:09:02]
 And this will show up down here as well so we have come down to the bottom [0:09:07]
 and if we bring it out to see all the constraints we can see we got the constraint 7 there with [0:09:14]
 6 millimeter and it's got a formula on the end this one here. That's just put that back. [0:09:22]
 So we need to do the same with all the rest so let's take this one and place length in here [0:09:29]
 and click the formula editor. Same is master sketch dot constraints dot base profile radius. [0:09:44]
 That's 40 millimeters here okay okay again and that once in there now. [0:09:50]
 Come in we can see that this isn't constraint here so I'm going to click on those two [0:09:56]
 and put those quits into each other. We have constraint click on constraint we see that constraint [0:10:03]
 there points in line constraint and that's hit the lead. So that's in place so we've started [0:10:09]
 creating our shape. Now we need an arc so I'm going to put in an arc and use an [0:10:18]
 input and a root point click on this one and come in to our here on this line and just bring [0:10:25]
 this arc around. I'm going to make sure it's going to make sure that these two. [0:10:30]
 So this point here needs two points are in line and place another line [0:10:38]
 so connect up with this one. It's a quits in constraint to that center point there [0:10:44]
 and delete any redunner constraints. Now we've still got on the master sketch [0:10:51]
 this one here so the length here which is just 15 millimeters I didn't actually name this one [0:10:59]
 so this click for this one or name and I'll just call this one overhang something like that. [0:11:05]
 Not quite sure what to call this one so I'm just going to call it that for the time being and hit [0:11:10]
 close and come back into the sketch and set the length from here click on the formula and type in [0:11:22]
 must sketch dot. It's just a down arrow to get to there. It's a strengths dot and overhang [0:11:29]
 and hit okay so now we've got that one in there we're just going to make this one and this one [0:11:38]
 tangent to each other and here okay so we've got fully constrained sketch that can hit close, [0:11:45]
 slip that sketch and come to the part design come down to create a additive feature and revolve [0:11:53]
 that the full free 60 and here okay so now we've got the starts of our object so we've got the main [0:12:02]
 revolve so now we're going to tackle a lot by clicking on this face and creating a sketch [0:12:07]
 we're going to create two profiles that are the same but different radiuses so we're going to use [0:12:13]
 this radius here and this one so we know the length here you can do this in a certain way because I [0:12:20]
 want to duplicate the sketch let's create a sketch on that face and what we'll normally do is just [0:12:25]
 pull in this circle and use that to attach a polyline too so I'll just pull in this circle and [0:12:34]
 just pull create basically a profile that's basically like this using this circle and producing [0:12:45]
 a point on object constraint to constrain these lines I can't do that because if I try to pull in [0:12:53]
 this edge when I duplicate it then after disconnect this edge to resize the whole lot [0:13:02]
 so I'm going to use a circle in here like so and then I'm going to pull in this edge but [0:13:13]
 I'm not going to connect out just yet so I'm going to pull in this edge and I'm going to come in and [0:13:17]
 start sketching upon this circle so using the polyline and we're going to alter constraint [0:13:25]
 to the circle and create a straight line that's up and I'll create this cross so we're going to go [0:13:32]
 straight line and come across straight line and I actually do it quite roughly so as long as it's all [0:13:41]
 constraint there and show you a quick tip of getting any straight so probably already know this but [0:13:49]
 the constraints is here to get a nice point of that if I want here to constrain all these I've got multiple [0:13:57]
 horizontal lines here so there's two ways of doing this click in them all all the horizontal ones [0:14:04]
 and adding a horizontal constraint in there or clicking the horizontal constraint first and then [0:14:10]
 select in the lines 1.1 because we've got the still got the two active and vertical constraints which [0:14:18]
 of these is one and this one and now we need to create some inline constraints so these two are inline [0:14:28]
 and these two need to be inline as well and using the quality so we take this one and this one [0:14:40]
 and make those equal and this one isn't vertical so that's at a vertical strength there [0:14:50]
 so we've got movement like so but we need to make sure that these two are inline as well [0:14:59]
 and that's how we'll see what we got so we've got a nice crossing there [0:15:06]
 that's take this circle and make it construction geometry so let's blue now and then take this [0:15:14]
 circle and this circle make those equal so no reporting the external geometry I've made the construction [0:15:22]
 geometry equal to this standard geometry and we'll see the reasons why in a minute and we take this line [0:15:28]
 and put some length in there which would constrain it and we'll set that to around 12 millimeters [0:15:36]
 that's good so we've got that one there as it closed we've got this crossing here I'm going to [0:15:44]
 duplicate that sketch so click on sketch come out to edit and do please let it object now it's [0:15:51]
 going to duplicate all of them so we will need to take the last one off but I'll leave our sketch [0:15:56]
 still selected there and here okay we've got addupe sketch and if I right click and rename this [0:16:04]
 and change it to top profile and the same with the other one to bottom profile [0:16:13]
 I can now take the top profile and set some height so looking back at the master sketch we know [0:16:25]
 we've got a height in here so this is going to be the loft height we haven't named that yet [0:16:31]
 so let's come in and set this one to loft height here enter come in close and come down to [0:16:42]
 the top profile and we want to come into the attachment and the position so this one here [0:16:50]
 let's find out and look at the set and use a former editor on the end and using the master sketch [0:16:58]
 dot constraints dot loft height so we've got 70 millimeters in there and hit okay [0:17:06]
 and click off let's place that there so directly upon there now if we've changed this [0:17:15]
 and we actually started this revolve on this point then we would have to mine us this [0:17:22]
 higher off so this height here but we didn't so we're okay at the moment this profile is way too big [0:17:28]
 so let's come into that top profile and adjust that now if we look at this we've got blue circle here [0:17:36]
 comes left hand side and look at what we've imported so we've got all the elements in here [0:17:43]
 and we've got this element here number 14 so it's got purple dot in the middle let's come over [0:17:49]
 to the top and drop down this mode and look for external we see that's a sterile geometry that one [0:17:57]
 there that is the sterile geometry from here so we need to delete that so just right click and delete [0:18:04]
 so that's gone now so we can actually move this one to a different [0:18:09]
 radius now remember we set radius for this one you know a master sketch so we close and have [0:18:18]
 look at our master sketch we've got this one here so coming to the master sketch if I come down [0:18:24]
 to constraints I can actually see all those constraints in the master sketch so I've got the more [0:18:29]
 named here so this quick way of figuring out whereabouts those constraints are so we're looking [0:18:37]
 at the top profile radius and I've realized I've spilt sphere on there but that's okay [0:18:41]
 it's placed spaces in there remember we hung up spaces so that's come into that top profile [0:18:51]
 and set the radius of this let's do a source in space and come up to the radius [0:19:00]
 using the form of a data and must sketch dot constraints dot top profile radius [0:19:15]
 15mm okay yeah okay again we've changed that now I'm going to change also this length here [0:19:26]
 so the moment that's 12mm I could use enough of form and go back to the original [0:19:32]
 base profile and say divide this by two so we have six mil but we can do that and [0:19:39]
 enough of time so I'm just gonna add that one there so remember we create a construction geometry [0:19:44]
 and then sketch that cross in there and then attach the construction geometry to the external geometry [0:19:51]
 if we would have just created the cross inside the external geometry and attached it to that [0:19:57]
 external geometry then leading that external geometry we would have lost the constraints against [0:20:03]
 that cross and we would have to create a new circle change that to construction mode and then reattach [0:20:10]
 each of those points we've point to nine constraint around the outside and this is why we did [0:20:17]
 this first with the construction geometry and then made the diameter of that construction geometry equal [0:20:24]
 to the external geometry that we're putting safe this a lot of time now be wary because when [0:20:32]
 we'd loft here we're probably gonna create a non-planar face which we're gonna have to attach [0:20:38]
 a sketch too which we're gonna go for in a moment as it close now scrape out of [0:20:46]
 we've got a bottom and the top profile come up to part design create as a feature and [0:20:55]
 have a safe loft it's gonna ask you what profile we need to use I'm gonna slip the bottom profile this one here [0:21:02]
 one that's attached to this object and here okay now we need to add a section [0:21:08]
 so I had section come in and set one of the edges of this profile we've lofted [0:21:16]
 to that if you pick a vertex it will be lofted to a point to that vertex which we don't want [0:21:23]
 let's see okay now we've got our loft if I decide that well this loft is too near I can come [0:21:33]
 back to the master sketch and change the size of this so we've got 70 millimeters here if you're [0:21:40]
 gonna click on it then just roll over again and click there we go double click and I'll go set this to [0:21:48]
 80mm must move that up I hit close everything rule recompute and we'll go back like that [0:21:56]
 let's add the sphere in here so to do that make sure I've clicked off and we're gonna use [0:22:05]
 something that we have a new chat and that's part design create an additive primitive and these [0:22:11]
 all the additive primitives here so we've got as if boxed attitude to a russet etc and we're after [0:22:17]
 the added this bit this will add the sphere to the screen but we can't see at the moment because [0:22:22]
 it's actually embedded at the center of origin which is inside here let's come in and change the [0:22:31]
 radius as sphere so I set it to 20 and you'll see it pop out the bottom there that's good we now need to [0:22:39]
 set where it's gonna set so you can see this attachment at the moment saying sledding that means that [0:22:45]
 we can select something if you're saying reference one or anything else make sure we click on that [0:22:49]
 and we can select that top face and that'll move that sphere to that top face like so [0:22:54]
 and we can get an idea of the radius of what we want that sphere to be so I'm gonna see 30 [0:23:02]
 click off and that's looking about right that's maybe go to 25 [0:23:09]
 there we go so it should be about 25 so we can come in and use the formula and reference this back to [0:23:17]
 master sketch we've got constraint in there is for the sphere that's actually spelled incorrectly [0:23:25]
 so dot sphere radius without the E and that's here okay so I need to change that sphere [0:23:37]
 radius because there's only 10 at the moment so that's okay that can come back into the master sketch [0:23:42]
 and change this sphere radius so double click that you can see I got sphere radius there [0:23:48]
 25 and change the name to an E so what do you think might happen I say okay and hit close [0:23:58]
 that's sphere has changed size so I double click on that sphere or I actually come down [0:24:04]
 into the data view we've got the radius here so click on it click on the formula to on the end [0:24:13]
 and you can see we've got sphere radius spelled correctly so almost like I've done that on purpose [0:24:19]
 so you can see how edcine name of the constraint gets our data to uniform as well so this here [0:24:26]
 okay and we now got this object here I want to take the section out of this so I want to follow [0:24:37]
 this face here going forward and intersecting this sphere now there's two ways to do this [0:24:46]
 we can add a sketch to this face so if I add a sketch it's going to complain that's not a [0:24:55]
 plan of face that means we don't have all the vertices of that face on the same plane [0:25:02]
 so here okay we can't create a sketch upon there there's two things that we can do [0:25:08]
 one way which it's often frowned upon but it has its benefits it's to use some good [0:25:15]
 data to play the reason why it's frowned upon it is it takes more computer power to actually process this [0:25:21]
 let me show you how it works so we're going to use the data plane on this face [0:25:29]
 and all this does it creates enough plane that's attached to this face [0:25:35]
 so coming use the data plane you can see we've got that plane that's been placed [0:25:43]
 upon that face that's it okay we can sketch upon this plane now so click the plane [0:25:51]
 top of it and crochet sketch now I word warning and it's done exactly what I for [0:25:57]
 it might do it's placed beyond the wrong side of the object so we're looking at the rear [0:26:04]
 so to fix that all we need to do is just close and there's an option on the sketch to [0:26:10]
 that reverse there's also the same option on the data plane so we've got a matte reverse there we can use [0:26:15]
 Eva or let's use it on the sketch back reverse that's true click off and we'll have [0:26:23]
 if we double click on that sketch it's now on the correct side so it's on the other side now we're [0:26:29]
 looking down on that if I hit the section for you all kind of sketch for you section it's [0:26:37]
 light is through there so you can see it's light in right through there and we can decide [0:26:42]
 what to bring in what geometry to bring in I want to remove that face like that so we've got [0:26:50]
 something to place enough of feature upon trouble is I'm not going to be able to get to any of [0:26:57]
 the geometry underneath if I try to hover over some of this you can see some of it's coming through [0:27:03]
 half a season so how do we get round with that? Well it's a simple one is hitting the right [0:27:09]
 mouse button to get the point of back comes the model and hiding in the dust and plane [0:27:14]
 and coming back to that sketch and now when we bring in the geometry that's bringing this point [0:27:23]
 the sequence if we can get at that point here is vertex and also there's a vertex if we look at the [0:27:32]
 scene we'll be running from the middle so we can utilize that vertex as well spring in that vertex [0:27:39]
 it can't get the vertex you can get the line so this gives me a way of sectioning through [0:27:49]
 this along this face got two vertices imported and that's crates a circle that's on this line [0:28:01]
 and bring it around and we're going to attach to this vertex point of line constraint and [0:28:10]
 also we're going to attach to the top one as well look at the right mouse button take the top [0:28:16]
 vertex we're the top point and this circle and the point of line constraint that's fully [0:28:22]
 constrained and we can pocket this now you may have noticed this that if we pocket we're going to go [0:28:30]
 downwards we just use a reverse pocket there's an option on the pocket so clicking on the pocket [0:28:37]
 we'll see that's gone down as like so and if we increase this you can see it's going down even further [0:28:45]
 so if we come to reverse and click off at the moment it's done nothing so that changes to some [0:28:54]
 like through all and that's gone all the way up there if you have problems and it looks a bit fun [0:29:03]
 here doesn't look quite right then just swap these over to first and then through all and it will [0:29:10]
 refresh correctly now we've done that as he okay we've now basically finished our object we can [0:29:18]
 create something in here that say another sketch and that's add a circle in here and this can be [0:29:27]
 say another pocket in here so we can pocket that let's just go for the default so we create [0:29:39]
 this whole thing from must sketch yourself at this part what does that mean well we can use the [0:29:45]
 master sketch and change the dimensions in here before I do that let's say this and if we change [0:29:57]
 the dimensions will happen that's changed say the radius of the loft which is this one here [0:30:07]
 and change the radius to say 30 so let's bring in this in to here now we've got 50 millimeters here [0:30:15]
 so that's send this out to 20 to change the thickness to 5 and hit close we've now changed everything [0:30:29]
 on there we've got no errors and everything's reccomputed now remember what I was saying back to [0:30:35]
 the datum plane this is where the datum plane comes in handy because it's attached to that face it will [0:30:42]
 move and flow with this face so it will change the angle as this face changes angle and here close [0:30:52]
 you can see we've got this loft and this datum planes added to this face and we've got a different [0:31:00]
 angle that we've got a different angle on the top so that datum plane is floating with that what's [0:31:07]
 normally advised if you don't want to use a datum plane is that we actually use a sketch and angle it [0:31:15]
 across here but the problem is that we're not going to get this type of flow with that sketch [0:31:21]
 unless we do something quite clever with that sketch and change the angle and the connect it up to [0:31:27]
 reference angle in here and there's ways of doing that but I'm not going to go into it for this [0:31:33]
 tutorial I'm going to leave that for another tutorial we use something called a reference geometry [0:31:39]
 in there so we can actually set geometry to a reference angle for instance you're coming to the master [0:31:45]
 sketch so this 20 millimeters here for the click that and set that to reference that meat for hit okay [0:31:51]
 that has become not constrained so you can see that's not constrained there and we can change that [0:31:59]
 to why everyone so we could have an angle on here we could connect up the angle say to here [0:32:09]
 along that loft so it follows that loft and place a reference angle in there and incorporate that [0:32:17]
 into our geometry so from this lesson you've learned how to control a part design model through [0:32:23]
 a master sketch and also learn about formulas or the expression editor in our next video we're [0:32:30]
 going to be looking at hidden attachments in objects so for instance if I look at this object [0:32:36]
 if I wanted to tap this tool wall without sharing say some holes that go around the outside here [0:32:44]
 that have screwed through then I need to make a hidden attachment in the back now this could be [0:32:50]
 some kind of slot or bayonet attachment and we're going to be looking how to create that feature in [0:32:56]
 here because we need to know how to model internal features so I want to make say a groove in here [0:33:06]
 but have the groove enclosed slightly so we will latch on to any screw or bolt that we have attached [0:33:13]
 to our wall that we can just twist this onto we won't be recreating the same model again we can just [0:33:19]
 create this on a basic disc shape but we can attach this to that attachment for our end example [0:33:27]
