===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 13 - Locking Mount - Understanding Pocket Types and Options =====
 I have one and welcome back to the Learning FreeCAD for beginners, where this series takes you through [0:00:04]
 learning the fundamentals of free CAD, whilst understanding workflows and demonstrating those [0:00:10]
 with practical examples. We're going to be looking at part design pocket options in this video. [0:00:16]
 I'll for you to look at how the pocketing works and the different types of pockets that you can do [0:00:22]
 regarding the through all two-face, two-dimensional, etc. We're going to learn how to make this [0:00:29]
 type of fastener. So this is a plate and we could have something on the back of here, but this will [0:00:37]
 fasten to a wall and screws will be hidden. So they're coming here and the screws will fit into this [0:00:45]
 wall. It's been seen. We've got a lip in here and when this is rotated anti-clockwise, then this will be [0:00:54]
 locked into position. Now this use is two pockets, but we're playing with the different types of [0:01:01]
 pockets that we're using in that to create this feature. We're going to be going through all of the [0:01:06]
 pocketing types and all of the padding types they need in use and understand that when you [0:01:11]
 pocket something with it's symmetrical with it's reversed, with it's normal to sketch or if it follows [0:01:17]
 an edge and we can use those to our vantage to build our models. So I hope you're enjoying this series [0:01:23]
 and that's how we look at these options. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have [0:01:29]
 a co-fire or a coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that's at ko-highfinfide.com [0:01:37]

 4-mango jelly solutions. Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. So for this [0:01:51]
 demonstration we're in the part design I'm going to create a new object and basically create a new [0:01:56]
 body and a new sketch in that body. Now just going to use the x-wire plane to demonstrate the [0:02:03]
 different types of pocketing and padding options that we have. So for this I'm going to use a very [0:02:10]
 basic shape so I'm going to use a rectangle that's symmetrical to the center and inside that I'm [0:02:18]
 just going to place some basic pockets that are going to be either side of this vertical line here [0:02:27]
 and we're just using symmetry to mirror that across. It closed and we're creating a standard [0:02:33]
 paddle with that sketch taking the defaults of about 10mm let's go 15mm to go a bit of space there. [0:02:40]
 Now to understand how these options for the padded and pocketing works I'm going to start with [0:02:48]
 pocket and I'm going to create a new sketch on this side and section for you through that and I'm [0:02:54]
 just going to create a circle. Now that's attached that circle to that face here and if we hit [0:03:01]
 close we can see the circle on that face. Now for go for a standard pocket using the part design [0:03:09]
 is a strategy feature it's a pocket it will just pocket into that face like so has standard length [0:03:17]
 of 5mm all going to do is have a look at these and understand how they work. So I mentioned [0:03:23]
 with length of 5mm means that's going to be 5mm it needs to be normal to the sketch you can see [0:03:30]
 the direction edge there sketch normal so it's going where the sketch is it's going to away from that [0:03:36]
 sketch so bring about the model pocket and look at that sketch and press the space point you can see [0:03:41]
 that sketch is in there. We're going to do why I'm here and going to click on that body and make [0:03:45]
 it transparency come into the view and we'll come down to the transparency which is here and set [0:03:53]
 this to something like 50 this means that if we bring this around we can see what we're doing in here [0:04:01]
 so pocket is sitting there let's come back to the task and see what we've got type dimension length [0:04:07]
 5mm replacing this in a positive dimension crease the pocket into there if we try to go negative [0:04:17]
 then it won't actually allow us if we hit okay it's not allow us to go negative [0:04:25]
 now the reason why we would want this to go negative I say that this which it is is a plan of [0:04:32]
 face and this is a non-planar face over here then we could actually pocket through a non-planar face [0:04:39]
 by using a plan of face this side but we're not going to get it for this because we can't have [0:04:45]
 minus length in there the way to do that is click reverse and bring up this length [0:04:54]
 and while happen it will reverse it and go this way so if this was say a curve surface here we can [0:05:03]
 actually pocket it from the plan of surface from this side moving in the direction [0:05:09]
 I'm going to change the type to through all now you can see that's placing it through all [0:05:21]
 or those avoids there and now the other side so anything in the way of that pocket [0:05:29]
 will go through all of this object the same with the reverse it will go in the reverse direction [0:05:36]
 symmetrical to plane that means that it will go out equal lengths this side and this side [0:05:45]
 but because it's through all it's going to go through all the way through there we come to [0:05:50]
 symmetrical to plane in a minute and dive into that a bit more because I'm going to move that [0:05:55]
 sketch just to demonstrate what that actually does move down to the next one and it goes to the first [0:06:02]
 face so anything in front of that until it comes to a face will be pocketed through and it will [0:06:11]
 pocket out the other side of the face but it doesn't go any further it's got that to first [0:06:16]
 and if we hit reverse what will happen and we may have to tweak the values so that's just [0:06:26]
 tweaked the offset you can see it's gone this way so it's come out back the reverse and it's [0:06:34]
 hit the other face but it's not going any further there's an offset here so that's changed this back [0:06:41]
 to reverse let's go on that way let's change this offset so let's reduce this down and you can see [0:06:49]
 it moving away from that face so it's going to the first face it comes to and then we're backing [0:06:55]
 up 4mm so if you think about if we're drilling a hole and we want to leave a gap this side [0:07:03]
 we can just use to first and create an offset from that first face by 4mm so we got a bit of gapish there [0:07:12]
 if we go reverse then we can use this offset in a different way so I'm going to zero out the offset [0:07:21]
 go minus you can see not much is happening there until we get to a high value and it's coming out [0:07:30]
 this side so what's happening is going to reverse it's gone this way and the offset is bought it back [0:07:36]
 so that's zero that and you can see that it's created a face on this side just here and if I [0:07:45]
 place this into a positive offset that's pocketed it in that side take the reverse off zero out [0:07:56]
 the offset and that's changed this to out to face now this can be a bit problematic when [0:08:03]
 selecting the face what this allows you to do is let the face that you want to pop out to [0:08:09]
 so we can pop it out to this one and that'll create a face on that side remember we'll [0:08:17]
 got the offset as well so I can actually drill into that face if I increase we go this way [0:08:22]
 if I decrease we go in that face there that's zero that out and click off now we've got this face here [0:08:32]
 if I delete that I should be able to select another face so if I select that one you can see it's [0:08:38]
 not really doing anything and even if we change anything the bottom and select that face [0:08:46]
 that's already doing anything it must be a little bug around here because if when I change it to [0:08:52]
 one of the options and come back then this is all clear and I can select another face I'll [0:09:01]
 select this face you see it's gone up to there go set we can back it off that's face [0:09:07]
 all we can drill all the way through that and into the next face there let's go in there [0:09:15]
 let's just change and zero this out and come back so that face we still got the option there [0:09:27]
 let's take that out and let's let another face we'll have to change it first and come back [0:09:34]
 onto face the little bug around there and we'll select that one so that's gone all the way through [0:09:40]
 and out the other side and reverse well this won't actually reverse it but we look at this [0:09:48]
 offset and pull this back see it's going to one is value there if I click reverse [0:09:56]
 and then put this to positive value you can see the reverse is having a fit on that offset [0:10:05]
 so the loss of the options that we have if I go two dimensions is this one here the two dimensions [0:10:18]
 with the length of five mil the second length of five mil now this is where it's worth [0:10:23]
 moving that sketch to show you what's actually happening in here that's kind of why I'll come [0:10:28]
 into the sketch and move this using the data coming up and we're looking at the attachment because [0:10:36]
 it's attached to the space I'm going to place it somewhere in the middle of this object here [0:10:40]
 point to the attachment it is along the x axis but it's connected so we're going to be looking at [0:10:49]
 the sketch planes so it'll actually be normal to sketch along the z axis this one here so [0:10:57]
 let's move that in so that's inside our object now let's click on the body set the transparency on the [0:11:04]
 view and we'll go that sketch inside so now we can see what happens with creating a pocket [0:11:15]
 and coming into the two dimensions we're going to do is also look at the pocket [0:11:25]
 look at the sketch in there process baseball so we've got the two dimensions there [0:11:28]
 and what we've done is basically pocket that so you can see in there [0:11:37]
 with our sketch sitting in the middle so we've got five mil is one way [0:11:43]
 we increase that this increases the length of along the second length and we've got this [0:11:49]
 otherwise we'll decrease that along the first length so where this is attached it's attached [0:11:57]
 it here our first length will go down our second length will go up [0:12:01]
 we hit reverse it just flips these directions so if I increase this one this is our second length [0:12:11]
 but our length going down has changed and we go and they reverse off they're just [0:12:19]
 versing there they're just flips these values now this is a center that's come back to our [0:12:26]
 dimension and look at the symmetrical to plane so at the moment this is going five mil meters [0:12:32]
 if I click symmetrical to plane note where the sketch is the symmetrical to plane sketch is now [0:12:40]
 in the middle of that pocket so the pocket is going symmetrical to the plane of the sketch [0:12:46]
 we increase these we're getting the length divided by two across there [0:12:52]
 they can see that symmetry there so we're going symmetrical I'll take that off we go reverse [0:13:00]
 and normal we've got those there and the same if we come out to the through all [0:13:06]
 as we said before I sit in the middle there's reverse on this symmetrical which if that [0:13:15]
 symmetrical to plane it's going to go through anything that's in the way of that sketch [0:13:19]
 going forwards and backwards along that normal factor there [0:13:25]
 also got the taper so let's come into the dimensions and also we're going to the sketch [0:13:38]
 going into the data that z axis the long attachment normal position which is going to reset that [0:13:44]
 so it's there the seed ticks all the way through so we may need to refresh [0:13:50]
 so let's come out to edit and refresh so we've got our normal pocket we've attached the sketch [0:13:58]
 to this face remember and we've got the pocket going this way now we've got a taper angle in here [0:14:04]
 we bring this taper angle up you can see the bottom is flaring out [0:14:09]
 if we bring it down the bottom pause in to that point there [0:14:19]
 and the reverse sends this backwards so it'll actually send it back with this way [0:14:25]
 and the symmetrical to plane well let's move the sketch inwards again [0:14:32]
 by minus 15 and it refresh you see what's happened there so we've got this shape so we've made this [0:14:48]
 symmetrical and we've taper either side like so [0:14:54]
 and the same if this is two dimensions we can change the dimensions [0:15:05]
 and taper them so we've got different taper angles for each so we've got taper angle [0:15:14]
 for the first and the taper angle for the second as well so we've got control over those [0:15:22]
 I'm going to change the sketch now so it can cancel out there we're going to do is remove this [0:15:32]
 constraint this allows me to place this and angle like so let's close that [0:15:38]
 I'm going to take the sketch and change where it's attached to so I can do that [0:15:45]
 but click on the sketch coming as the support click on on that clear in that's our [0:15:51]
 and pick in a new support so it goes pick this support here this face this one okay [0:15:59]
 and looks like we still got some z-axes on here so that's zero that out so we've got no offset [0:16:11]
 on our attachment and that should sit there now I've got this sketch here that's the look [0:16:18]
 a following an edge so I'm going to poke it that and this time rather than sketch normal [0:16:27]
 and drop this down and let reference the sketch has disappeared I select this line here [0:16:35]
 so what's happening is that if I increase this length it's actually following that line as [0:16:43]
 use the reverse and you can see how that's kept in line with that edge so it's an angle [0:16:52]
 long that edge now this is can be quite useful let's cancel out there and look at this [0:16:59]
 sketch and move this sketch into a different position now I'm going to move that by bringing [0:17:06]
 in some geometry now what this vertex that sets right here got the vertex there [0:17:14]
 I'm going to attach this center point off this circle to that vertex and the moment [0:17:23]
 we can see it's gone over constraint so I'm going to remove that point on line constraint there [0:17:30]
 and delete it so now the profile of this circle is on that edge nice it close [0:17:38]
 now that's used the pocket it's going down at the moment I want it reversed [0:17:47]
 and I'm going to select a reference this time this edge you can see what's happened there it's [0:17:58]
 following that edge and we're getting that half circle there that's used normal direction because [0:18:05]
 we've got it reversed at the moment and increase that change this to first and we've now [0:18:16]
 created a groove running along that edge using that edge's reference so for a practical demonstration [0:18:26]
 we'll come back into the part design and we're going to be looking at a way of using [0:18:31]
 those pocket options and those pocket types in there so I'm creating a new body and creating a new [0:18:34]
 sketch going along the x-fi plane and hitting ok looking down from the top [0:18:39]
 and I'm going to create a simple disk in here and I'm going to put some geometry in here that [0:18:47]
 allow me to attach this to a wall over a screw or a large headed nail so it's locked in so it [0:18:54]
 doesn't come off the wall you see these on fire alarms and boxes that attach the wall this is [0:18:58]
 your simple sketch hit close and we can pad this 10 mill will do let's see okay so that's how [0:19:07]
 we'll look at doing twist lock on here and create a sketch on this face new sketch we're going to [0:19:14]
 create two circles for guidance all out of us to guide our groove so we'll close to there [0:19:22]
 it's creating another circle I'm going to attach it to this line and also I'm going to create another [0:19:30]
 circle inside here so I've got these here I'm going to make this circle tangent to these two lines [0:19:38]
 here so I'm going to use the tangent c make sure enough it's slatted use the tangent c [0:19:42]
 and take this circle and this one and this circle and this one so that's tangent now [0:19:50]
 now we want to keep this one which will be the screw head so that sets and dimensions in here [0:19:58]
 now we use the 5 millimetre for the screw head and bring this down and you see what we need to do we need to [0:20:05]
 think about the diameter of the shaft of the screw and have this symmetrical over these two lines [0:20:14]
 that's quite easy by using a point off the user point as you use a point [0:20:19]
 called to constraints on and that's constrained it to inner circle and on point to the outer circle [0:20:25]
 also going to hit this skate and constrain this point to this line point on object constraint [0:20:32]
 and do the same with this one so those points will move along there with that circle and be attached [0:20:43]
 I can now use symmetry by taking the two points and the center of the circle [0:20:49]
 here and using the symmetry constraint to the redundant constraints it delete and now we get [0:21:00]
 symmetry across that circle you can see the upper circle is moving in an out [0:21:07]
 and I can also use these two points and place a height in here this is going to be the [0:21:18]
 shaft diameter around about four millimetres actually I actually said it to three so we've got [0:21:28]
 three millimetres there it's bringing this up so you can see what we're doing [0:21:35]
 we could use some angle constraints to constrain this circle down to the center here and [0:21:44]
 let's do that so for instance I could have had a line I could have it's up to this point and here [0:21:54]
 change this to constraction geometry and we can set the angle between these two [0:22:05]
 now let's come over and pick the angle about 11 degrees so that's constraction geometry that won't [0:22:13]
 show up and we're set of a diameter or we could even set a coming here and use this point [0:22:22]
 and this one and set a height full of constraints it of 30 millimetres so we've got that constraint down [0:22:37]
 let's set these two to constraction so now this is all constrained down that's have a look [0:22:47]
 and to create the necessary geometry to connect these two together and trim them out [0:22:52]
 for that I'm going to use an end points and room point arc we're going to take one circle [0:23:00]
 and the other circle will make sure as a point on line and create an arc between those [0:23:06]
 here's scape and we're bringing this into position and you can see how we want that to be placed [0:23:17]
 in there and take this point and this arc point on arc constraint this needs the radius so [0:23:26]
 we're going to click on it and use this one makes those equal so we've got that radius in there [0:23:33]
 and that's not actually attached to there there we go point on object constraint so we got that one [0:23:40]
 there we do the same down the bottom so I'm putting a room point arc that's this one [0:23:45]
 connect to this one at the arc escape take the arc take the lower circle make those equal [0:24:00]
 that will give them equal radius or equal diameter there then take the points and the circle [0:24:09]
 attach them up we'll point an object constraint so they sit there fully constrained and we'll [0:24:18]
 use the trim edge and remove this circle and this part of the circle and they're all connected up [0:24:28]
 like so so all fully constrained as it close and we've got our feature there [0:24:37]
 which we can pocket into our object and this is basically the same process so let's put this [0:24:47]
 pocket off three millimeters and click on the face new sketch come in and pull in some [0:24:59]
 geometry so we're going to pull in this edge here and this edge like so now we're going to use the [0:25:11]
 slot good cool to constraint to this point and order constraint to this point hit escape [0:25:18]
 make sure that this arc and this arc are equal therefore this arc will be equal as well [0:25:26]
 because we've got tangency across here and we've got a quality across these arc so we've got that one there [0:25:33]
 take close we now need to offset that using the z on that sketch moving it down [0:25:46]
 into the material underneath now we'll move that down to minus 1.5 [0:25:53]
 use the pocket on that sketch you can see that's pocket out already and we need to go [0:26:05]
 to first so we've got that feature in there and if we want to go get further we can so [0:26:14]
 0.5 mil further if we want to so we've got that void in there [0:26:23]
 got a lift to stop the screw from coming out on it's over this side we'll push net this way it will [0:26:31]
 release it from the screw that's here okay now that's polar ray this so we've got that there we need [0:26:41]
 another one over the other side so we want it here going in the reverse direction so make sure nothing [0:26:48]
 selected and click on the polar pan or part design create a pattern or apply a pattern [0:26:57]
 polar pan it's going to ask us for which features that we need now we need to we need [0:27:04]
 the pocket 0.01 and the other pocket not the pack this was original pad the two pockets make up [0:27:12]
 our feature so we had one pocket that did this outer and then we did the inner part so [0:27:20]
 controls that both of those and here okay got that feature down the bottom now so you can see how that's [0:27:27]
 going inside there if we only selected one then we only got one feature there that's perfect we only need [0:27:35]
 the two we want to do we could do another one plus correct when screws are in here and this is turned [0:27:45]
 anticlockwise it locks into position so there you go and just here okay we've now got that feature inside there [0:27:56]
 in our next video we're going to be using the techniques that we've used in the previous videos [0:28:03]
 along with a technical drawing for reference to create our models we're going to be looking at a [0:28:08]
 number of workflows of how you create those different models and different paths you can take with [0:28:14]
