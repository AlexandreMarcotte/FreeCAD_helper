===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 14 - Making a Basic Easy Model with Different Workflows - Workbenches =====
 I have one and welcome back to another episode of the Learning Free CÃ¡dite for beginners, [0:00:04]
 where we teach the fundamentals of free CAD from a beginner's perspective, why so we [0:00:09]
 learn workflows. [0:00:11]
 In this episode episode 14, we're going to be learning both apart and apart design workflow. [0:00:17]
 We're going to be using the technical drawing to create this object. [0:00:20]
 I'm going to take you through a number of workflows where we read the technical drawing [0:00:25]
 alongside our modeling and we can understand the differences between apart [0:00:29]
 design and apart workflow. [0:00:32]
 So I hope you enjoy this series and let's have a look at this exercise. [0:00:37]

 To before we start, we're going to prepare our workspace and this will allow us to reference [0:01:06]
 the technical drawing and also model and sketch our model side by side with the reference [0:01:12]
 material. [0:01:14]
 To do that I'm going to come up to file and come down to open. [0:01:19]
 I'm going to pick my technical drawing which is this VG. [0:01:24]
 Here open is going to ask me how I want to open the SVG and I want to go for the drawing [0:01:30]
 option here. [0:01:32]
 Now here's a select. [0:01:34]
 So now I'll go our drawing and I'll create a new document. [0:01:39]
 So we've got the drawing which our reference is for TURAL and our new document. [0:01:44]
 Probably it's the north side by side at the moment there just in separate tabs. [0:01:47]
 Put the side by side to come up to Windows and click Tile. [0:01:52]
 That places them side by side. [0:01:54]
 Now if we want to place them back onto tabs as you can see we still got the tabs down [0:01:58]
 here, we just maximise the window like so and place it back into tile mode just come down [0:02:06]
 to tile. [0:02:08]
 Now I've got these side by side. [0:02:10]
 I can start sketching. [0:02:13]
 With the reference document we can zoom in and out by using the scroll wheel on the mouse [0:02:18]
 or using the two fingers on the touchpad of the laptop and we can click and drag to move [0:02:24]
 this about. [0:02:25]
 Look at the reference material we can see we've got a number of dimensions in here. [0:02:31]
 But we are missing dimensions such as the height of this piece here, the base plate. [0:02:38]
 And the position of where this arc starts. [0:02:43]
 So you can see we've got an arc here and we've got this line here. [0:02:47]
 Now think about this object we can tackle it a number of ways. [0:02:50]
 First thing to look at is do we have symmetry across the object which we do so we're [0:02:54]
 going to tackle it by just do one half a mirror and a cross to the other. [0:02:59]
 Look at this arc. [0:03:00]
 Well we could create a rotates or even a sweep with this part here. [0:03:07]
 Let's look at a rotate workflow using the part design. [0:03:10]
 We'll look at this in the parts as well and show how both of those workflows differ. [0:03:15]
 You can part design feature based modeling compared to the part Boolean based modeling. [0:03:20]
 What I like to do first is get an idea of the scale of the object by using some construction [0:03:26]
 geometry in a simple sketch. [0:03:29]
 And also we're going to be working out the basic size it's long here because we've got [0:03:33]
 this height. [0:03:34]
 We've got the inner height. [0:03:36]
 And we've got the dimensions of this and we've got a few measurements that we need to [0:03:41]
 work out. [0:03:42]
 We can do this with mass but I prefer to do it a more visual way. [0:03:45]
 So let's come over to freecat and I'm going to jump into the sketcher. [0:03:51]
 So now I plan on the left but our sketching is on the right. [0:03:55]
 Let's create a new sketch and we're going to do it along the x-head plane. [0:04:02]
 And here I go. [0:04:03]
 What I ask is to get some simple geometry in here for the heights. [0:04:09]
 So we're looking at this height here. [0:04:12]
 Not going to use the great point. [0:04:16]
 What we're going to do is attach the point to this line and this is going to represent [0:04:22]
 this height. [0:04:24]
 We're going to attach another point to represent this inner height so the height here. [0:04:31]
 Now we're going to attach another point and this is going to be the height of the base. [0:04:37]
 Now that's at the vertical distance. [0:04:40]
 So I'm just going to click on the vertical distance and I'm going to select the top [0:04:43]
 point and this center point. [0:04:49]
 And this is where we start getting an idea of the scale we're currently at and the heights [0:04:55]
 of the object. [0:04:56]
 So our height is 20mm so I'm going to type in 20. [0:05:01]
 This is from there we can zoom in and we need to bring this point with us so that's [0:05:06]
 escape and bring in this point down like so. [0:05:12]
 And now we can zoom in to get this into the right place and we're going to adjust our [0:05:18]
 windows to give us a bit more space to work with. [0:05:23]
 Now I've got the height in here. [0:05:25]
 That's figure out this height. [0:05:28]
 Now this needs a starting point and well we need to figure out where this point is in relation [0:05:35]
 to this point. [0:05:37]
 Now if you look it's the diameter of the loop that runs this way. [0:05:43]
 So we look down we've got a diameter here which is D which is 5mm so this is going to [0:05:49]
 be 5mm as a way these two points here. [0:05:52]
 Let's put a height in there or 5mm. [0:05:55]
 So we've got that height there. [0:05:59]
 So that's the diameter of the loop and the next one we want the height of 12mm so [0:06:06]
 we're taking these two points and a height of 12mm in there and here okay. [0:06:15]
 That leaves us with these two points and this will be our base height and we can place [0:06:23]
 a height in here and you can see that's saying 3mm. [0:06:29]
 Like here okay you can see that some three merges for the constraint within that [0:06:32]
 section is invalid and that's because we've got all these heights already [0:06:38]
 constrained in this down. [0:06:40]
 If you want to what we can do is take this, place a height and set this to reference. [0:06:46]
 That'll create a blue constraint in there which will take so you can see that [0:06:52]
 three more metres there. [0:06:53]
 We can name these up and use them in our modelling and just add them to the formula if we [0:07:00]
 want to or we can just reference back to this. [0:07:03]
 This stitch won't actually create part of our model it's just for reference and it's [0:07:08]
 just for explaining how we go about figuring out the dimensions for this shape. [0:07:14]
 That's add another point and a place of point here and this is going to be the length [0:07:21]
 so this length that runs this way we need to half that because that's the length here which [0:07:28]
 is 35mm so what we can do is hit escape to get the mouse put it back and take these two points [0:07:38]
 and place those at 35mm and then we divide that by two. [0:07:44]
 17.5mm so you can do plain maths in there if you don't want to calculate that in your head. [0:07:52]
 I'm now going to add another point so a point in here and this is going to be this length [0:08:01]
 here divided by two so 13mm is there and we can do the same we can take this point and that's [0:08:09]
 centre point and place the length so 13 divided by two 6.5mm we'll go in there like so. [0:08:19]
 So what we've done is we've created a number of dimensions in here and roughed out whereabouts [0:08:28]
 all these will go. This is important because the workflow we're looking at for the part design [0:08:35]
 we have to make each part connect as we go along so we create the base and then for this rotate [0:08:43]
 here we need to first make a pad and then a rotate we're going to be showing you how to do that [0:08:50]
 in a moment. First of all we need to figure out this arc here and whereabouts it sits because we haven't [0:08:57]
 got any height here we can see where this arc will start which is this point here so that's place [0:09:09]
 an end point and a Rinpoind arc in remember this is still using this just to rough this out so I'm [0:09:17]
 going to place an end point of Rinpoind and I'm going to take this point and attach it to this vertical [0:09:26]
 axis hit with a point and line constraint so you've got that there we can see the diameter of [0:09:35]
 a is 30mm so a going across here this is 30mm for this circle so I can click on that circle [0:09:43]
 and come up to the diameter and we'll make that 30. [0:09:52]
 So we've got that in there at the moment it can still move around and we can see that if we place a line [0:10:01]
 from here to here this will complete length that we need so this here and we've got that [0:10:11]
 ready to go so this is the arc that describes this in here get the right mouse button to get the mouse [0:10:20]
 point back and basically we've got all the dimensions we need now like what I said before we could [0:10:26]
 name these up say base height and this one base length etc and use those as constraint from [0:10:40]
 our sketches if we want to but I might just feed off those measurements so we can get an idea [0:10:48]
 of how the model is built up along with this plan so we'll then do this come over and close this [0:10:57]
 now and you can see we've described that arc there now we've got the starts to a sketch we can start [0:11:04]
 creating some of the geometry that's come over to the part design and we're creating body and [0:11:11]
 crane new sketch and I'm going to go along the x y plane this one here and here okay so we're looking [0:11:19]
 down upon the object let's get ourselves into position that's great our first [0:11:26]
 which is going to be rectangle and we're going to set the length here these two certain length here [0:11:36]
 I remember we can use the formula if we want to so we can go back to the sketch constraints [0:11:45]
 and base length 17.5 and here okay all we could just choose the 17.5 in there I say okay [0:11:56]
 that's in there piece of geometry and you can see that's scrolling in now it's [0:12:04]
 this causes this winder to move so that can be a little bit annoying sometimes and now I'm going [0:12:11]
 to take these two points so this point and this point I'm making a symmetrical with this point [0:12:18]
 using the symmetry constraint but we're done with constraints clicker and hit the delete button [0:12:26]
 so we're symmetrical there we need to set a height so clicking on this line and set a height [0:12:33]
 and that's how we'll let's see what we want we want to this width here which is 30 millimeters [0:12:38]
 click on that and set this to 30 and hit enter so we've got the starts here of our base let's hit close [0:12:48]
 we've got that there we can see how it's sitting it's going to the model times the sketch [0:12:58]
 which is inside this body and choose a pad we know it's padding three millimeters [0:13:04]
 all we could choose a special button on the end the formula button and enter that end [0:13:11]
 but it's going to go three millimeters there and here okay let's bring this back in [0:13:16]
 and have a look to see what we got so we've got that there and if I hide that we can see how that [0:13:24]
 sits upon there now I'm going to tackle this loop so I'm going to place the sketch upon this face [0:13:31]
 make sure we select this face and we go so just let that top face and create in this sketch [0:13:38]
 now we're going to place a profile upon here which is basically just the circle so we're looking at [0:13:45]
 this circle here of the profile of the loop click on the circle and attach it to this line like so [0:13:54]
 we know the diameter of this is five millimeters so that's a diameter of five mil [0:14:02]
 I'm going to attach a point to here so using this great point and I'm going to attach the point [0:14:12]
 to the circle this allows me to constrain this point to this point here let's first hit a [0:14:18]
 scape and also attach this point to this line so it's line horizontal line going here [0:14:23]
 we'll point to line because it's strange so if I move that point the whole lot moves [0:14:28]
 so we know the width which is 13 divided by two so 6.5 all we could pull in this geometry here [0:14:39]
 the thing you have to be worried about is that this sketch is outside the body so it's going to [0:14:44]
 pull in the geometry we need to move this sketch inside so it can be referenced so just be [0:14:48]
 aware of that if I try to use the link a standard geometry here and try to pull in this you can see [0:14:56]
 that if you look down to the bottom left the object belongs to another body can't link [0:15:00]
 I may sketch edge one let's press the right mouse button to the point about and what do is take [0:15:06]
 this sketch and bring it inside this body so it's there now that means when I pull this geometry [0:15:13]
 in I can actually do it so I can click on the stone geometry and you can see we can [0:15:18]
 highlight that line now and bring that in but I know the length between here and here [0:15:27]
 is the 13 millimeters divided by two so this is 6.5 so this length here [0:15:34]
 place a length 6.5 so that's sitting there so we've got our profile now of our object [0:15:43]
 go to the task and what we do is we'll hit close click on the button hit close and we've got [0:15:52]
 the circle ready to pad and revolve we're going to use a revolve for this but the problem [0:15:58]
 is is that we need to know how far to bring this profile up so we do need to pad first because we're [0:16:06]
 building this from the bottom upwards so if you think about it we need to have these all connected [0:16:12]
 but we also need this revolve now what I suggest doing is taking this profile [0:16:18]
 raising up to being in line with this point and then we can pad to this surface and then use the same [0:16:26]
 profile to revolve around this up let me show you how that's done we first need to understand [0:16:33]
 how far away from the base the profile needs to be so let's come into our reference sketch [0:16:40]
 and we've got this length here and if you look we've taken account the height of the base here [0:16:48]
 so we really need to split this as add a split so I'm going to use the split tool [0:16:53]
 split edge we'll cut out to sketch sketch geometries and split edge and place a split in here [0:17:03]
 and I'm going to hit a state to get a mouse point back and we're looking at this point which is the [0:17:10]
 3mm point and this one and we'll place those in line using the constraint horizontally [0:17:17]
 so now we know that this line here is going to be on the base sitting on that base there so we [0:17:25]
 get a vertex on that base and a vertex at the top here therefore we can take this line [0:17:32]
 place a height in here like so 5.5 and set this to reference we've got this height in here [0:17:42]
 and let's hit okay if we didn't set this to reference it will become redundant [0:17:47]
 we can name this if we want to add it to the formula but I now know that this is 5.5 so I can use [0:17:57]
 that in my model let's hit close so come over to hit the close button and we can see we've got this [0:18:06]
 point and this point at the top so now I can take my profile sketch which is this one [0:18:13]
 and we're quickly rename that to profile now let's come down to the attachment because that's [0:18:22]
 the very first property we have we've got the placement here which will be ruled only [0:18:28]
 come down we have the attachment first and we look at the position and we'll look at the z [0:18:34]
 and we set this to 5.5 and that places that there that's quickly save this [0:18:41]
 and now what we'll do is take this profile and create the revolve and the pad we can't [0:18:49]
 create the revolve first because if we try to do that click them and profile and create the revolve [0:18:55]
 it's going to allow us to do this because it connects up to the base what we want only one 90 degrees [0:19:01]
 and you can see it's disappeared and it won't take so there's cancelled that what we need to do is first [0:19:11]
 pad this to make a connection to this base so click on the profile click on the pad and we're going to go [0:19:19]
 reverse so that reverses that down to that base you can see the length of those 10mm [0:19:24]
 and what we'll do is drop down the dimension and go to first that'll bring that up to that first [0:19:35]
 face there or even up to face and select the face then we have the connection there I see it okay [0:19:45]
 so we have our pad now this one here if we open this up we've got the profile inside [0:19:51]
 click on the profile and press the space bar to show the profile to show you whereabouts it sits [0:19:58]
 we can now create the revolve along this up to click on the profile and then come up to part design [0:20:07]
 and it's nice to feature and evolve all we just use a revolve from toolbar [0:20:13]
 we're looking along the vertical sketch axis and we're set this to 90 [0:20:19]
 and click off so that's place that revolve in there and we'll hit okay [0:20:26]
 we just create one half of the model we're going to tackle the holes on this object now so these holes [0:20:33]
 hit now I have realized that I've missed out some of the dimensions on on this plan so I will update [0:20:40]
 those plans and you'll get something like this with those dimensions in there and you can see I've [0:20:44]
 created this intact draw and I'll export this out so the material we will have will have those dimensions [0:20:51]
 on so this hole is 5mm away from this edge and also the inner diameter is 3mm and we've got [0:21:02]
 the chamfer that brings out the 5mm is there so onemm each chamfer will bring that up to [0:21:07]
 5mm that's add that to our model to do that we click on this face just make sure that face is [0:21:14]
 selected nothing else and create a sketch and that's start bringing in the hole by creating a circle [0:21:24]
 going to hit escape and I'm going to add the diameter to the hole of 3mm [0:21:30]
 also going to bring in this point here to set that 5mm away from that edge using the [0:21:36]
 external geometry and click on that point and we'll take this point and this point [0:21:44]
 set a length of 5mm and do the same from this point to this point and do a height of [0:21:53]
 5mm so we've got those dimensions in there we're now going to take a copy of this and place it [0:22:02]
 over here and create the necessary constraints against that so just let that circle and we're [0:22:08]
 going to come up to sketch, sketch tools and use symmetry but first of all we need to set the circle [0:22:15]
 and use this line so click the circle click the line and if you've got a tool bar over here [0:22:23]
 a symmetry and that places a symmetry or that circle over here with the constraint against it [0:22:28]
 now we need to constrain it so we can use this point and this point and place [0:22:35]
 vertical strength that keeps those in line so it won't move left or right but it will move [0:22:41]
 up and down so we need to bring in but using the external geometry tool this point [0:22:47]
 and set a height between these two [0:22:52]
 and set that to 5mm that's fully constrained now as it close those circles are in there which [0:23:03]
 are going to create holes make sure it's selected and create our pocket [0:23:10]
 dimension of 5mm that's just changed this and go to first that bring that up to the first face [0:23:21]
 there counters and here okay now that's add some finishing in here which will be the chamfer's [0:23:29]
 and the fillets so I'm going to click on this circle and come up to part design apply address up [0:23:38]
 and chamfer that and we want to 1mm chamfer and here okay let's do the same for the other one [0:23:47]
 but we can add that to the current chamfer so double click on it and then add an edge and add [0:23:54]
 this one here and here okay so we've got both chamfer's and the one chamfer there [0:24:02]
 we now need to add the fillet so we look here we can see we've got this radius here of 4mm [0:24:11]
 let's click on this line and this time we can add it from the toolbar this will be in the [0:24:19]
 ply address up again but we're just going to use the fillet and you can see that's fillet enough [0:24:24]
 that edge and we want to radius of 4mm as add another edge and take this edge over here as well [0:24:33]
 and here okay so we just cleaned this up we can see we've got a fillet that runs all the way along here as [0:24:44]
 well and this just looks like a one-minute fillet there's no dimensions of this fillet in here but if we [0:24:49]
 look at this chamfer we can see that this line and this line are round about the same so that's [0:24:56]
 lips all the edges control slip them all and then come up to part design apply address up feature [0:25:10]
 and go for the fillet one millimeter let's fill this it blows off or around there I'll hit okay [0:25:15]
 so now we're going to the point in the project we need to mirror this I'm going to use the part design [0:25:21]
 ply pattern and mirrored from here we need to select the features that we're going to mirror [0:25:29]
 now this only happens if we've got nothing selected if I select something such as this pad [0:25:35]
 and this time we use the toolbar you can see we've just mirrored the pad so we have to add [0:25:42]
 each of the features in this list that's let the other pad and you can see that's been added there [0:25:49]
 and add feature and select the next one let's just cancel this and select all the features that we want to mirror [0:26:00]
 for that make sure nothing's selected use the mirrored and select all the features [0:26:07]
 now you may hear a problem when we do this and you get my get a transformation problem [0:26:13]
 which you'll have to fix so we've got that now we've got this red object here and it's saying [0:26:20]
 one transform shape does not intersect support and this could be down to which plane we've [0:26:27]
 selected here we've got the vertical sketch axis so we're mirroring over this plane here which is [0:26:35]
 fine there's nothing wrong with that so that's okay and we can change this if we wanted to [0:26:44]
 but we've got to find out what the problem is we saw before that just mirroring [0:26:51]
 the pad the second pad and the revolution was absolutely fine and it looks like we've got [0:26:58]
 a problem with the filets or the chamfer so that's add the pad the second pad the revolution and the [0:27:05]
 pocket and use the mirror which is absolutely fine that's add a feature come back to the model and click the [0:27:14]
 chamfer and straight away we have a problem there now I can look into this and find out what it is [0:27:21]
 and spend some time trying to figure out the solution to this all we could take a different approach [0:27:26]
 it's coming to task I think cancel so we're going to come down and actually instead of finishing [0:27:34]
 in the part design because this is the last option but I want to do just the mirror of the fillet [0:27:40]
 I can use say the part workflow I'm going to take that fillet and click it and cut the part [0:27:50]
 and mirroring and we're mirroring over a plane so let's have a look how it planes [0:27:56]
 look this way we got the Z and X so we're mirroring over this way so we're going to be mirroring [0:28:05]
 over the Z Y plane here this one here so you can see Z and Y so change this to Y Z and here okay [0:28:18]
 that's mirroring now so now we've got the fillet I will change workflows we've gone from part [0:28:27]
 designed to part and this is fine because we're just finishing this off this is our last actions [0:28:33]
 that we're going to do we're coming to this fillet spade out we can see the fillet there and our mirror [0:28:39]
 fillet so we can take these two and I have a crate he part compound make compounds that have [0:28:50]
 compounds together all we could Boolean and union those two together like so if we look down we've [0:28:58]
 got the fusion and this refinement has bring this down doesn't matter this will just get rid of [0:29:06]
 this middle line here so we've got our finished object there is another weight as well so let's get [0:29:14]
 rid of that fusion so I'm going backwards get rid of the fillet mirror up so we back to that fillet [0:29:21]
 and we're going to stay in the part design work inch got a fillet there and I'm going to believe [0:29:30]
 that for that and this one and the shumfa and I'm going to use the pad the second pad [0:29:40]
 revolution and the pocket and mirror those that's mirror it up to the fine that's here okay [0:29:48]
 and now we can finish this so we can add the shumfa's by clicking on all the circles [0:29:58]
 and we're at a 1mm shumfa to all these like that 1mm okay and then clicking these edges [0:30:10]
 some controls letting all the edges so show you a number of ways to get around the problems [0:30:16]
 and use the fillet and we know that's a 4mm fillet that's double check that so come over to [0:30:25]
 here and we can see the 4mm fillet there and here okay and then we can fill it around the outside [0:30:36]
 now at this point we've got this fillet here we can refine this if we want to [0:30:43]
 to this is the last action it's not actually the fillet it's just the action in there [0:30:48]
 and I've just refined that that means I've got all these edges that I can control so that [0:30:52]
 and go all the way around like so controls that to do all those and I fill that around there [0:31:06]
 and here okay so we've got those there and we're still in the part design [0:31:14]
 workflow we haven't broken out into a part we've kept it all in the same workflow [0:31:20]
 so if you come across problems like that then that's a way of solving that issue you may [0:31:27]
 want to spend the time in there trying to figure out the problem but the end of the day sometimes [0:31:32]
 we just want to quick model out there and we need to change our approach slightly or even bring [0:31:38]
 in a different workbench just to finish it off so with a mirror you can just bring in that [0:31:43]
 part workbench just to mirror that off and that's your object done so this changes workflow [0:31:49]
 we're going to be using the additive pipe that's quite easy to do I'm going to go through the [0:31:55]
 full workflow I'm just going to delete the fillet and this for the chamfer the mirror the pocket [0:32:02]
 the sketch here we can keep but it's the same process anyway so we're going to delete that [0:32:12]
 and I'm going to delete the revolve and that pad so basically gone back to where it was before [0:32:18]
 this profile sketch I'm going to load that back to the surface so we come into the attachment [0:32:27]
 this one here this is the first one for that profile because it's attached onto this surface [0:32:32]
 remember and we've dropped down to the z and we can zero that out to place it on there [0:32:39]
 now if we slet that profile and we're going to use this as a path to sweep across [0:32:47]
 got to part design, create additive feature and additive pipe it's taken the profile which is this one [0:32:56]
 it's now going to ask for an edge so we come down to post a sweep along that's add an edge [0:33:02]
 and click on this line click add an edge again and click on this arc [0:33:09]
 see okay now we've got that in there and we can add the circles for the holes [0:33:17]
 but just to quickly show you if I click this part and this additive pipe our mirror still works [0:33:25]
 so our mirror in means that we've got something like this which is basically the same as what we [0:33:33]
 had before but we've taken a different approach augmentedly a much easier approach to do this [0:33:40]
 object but what I've done is giving you two ways in the part design to allow you to create that [0:33:46]
 object now if you were creating this in say the part workbench then there's multiple ways you can do this [0:33:54]
 so let's have a look at a part workbench flow for the same object [0:33:57]
 I've converted back just to the normal sketches so we've got the base the profile and [0:34:05]
 this guide sketch here so doing the base is quite easy to click on the sketch for the base [0:34:13]
 and instead of a pad we use this route and that was three millimeters so that's done [0:34:20]
 now we've got to place our profile we're going along the same revolve workflow as before and we know from that sketch [0:34:30]
 we've got to move this up 5.5 millimeters [0:34:36]
 from the actual base so click on that profile coming to the placement it's not attached [0:34:44]
 we've placed the placement if it's attached something it will be attachment the position [0:34:51]
 and we'll just up to 5.5 and it was a bit further actually [0:35:02]
 to 8.5 so add in the free onto there there we go now we need to screw that so click on the [0:35:12]
 profile and we're going to screw that now the good thing here is we can select to edge so I want to [0:35:20]
 a screwdriver on this edge here to click on a long edge and hit select and select that edge there [0:35:28]
 and here okay and that's gone downwards if it doesn't go downwards and goes upwards [0:35:34]
 well we can click on that as screwed and come down and you'll see a reverse here and set this to true [0:35:41]
 will allow multiple bodies in the part workbench so that will be a valid model [0:35:49]
 next I'm going to take that profile which is inside that astrude click the profile for a space box [0:35:56]
 you can see that and we use a revolve we're going to revolve this along the y-axis to click on y [0:36:05]
 and hit okay and you see that's revolved along there I haven't added or removed any angle to that [0:36:14]
 so let's come into the revolution and set this to 90 degrees like so you can see we've got a problem [0:36:22]
 there and that's because the center is off so we have a bit of an issue so the best idea here is to find [0:36:28]
 some kind of reference to revolve this around let's delete that revolve click on it hit delete [0:36:36]
 and come into this profile and double click it and what we need to do is it's a revolve around [0:36:42]
 this line here so we need a line-breathing to revolve around so I'm going to close that [0:36:50]
 and I'm going to duplicate this sketch so come out to edit jucacylection and double click on that profile [0:36:59]
 I'm going to delete the circle and add a line so the line that goes along here connected to [0:37:10]
 those go around the constraint which would click on and delete and also I'm going to delete [0:37:17]
 this one and this point because we don't need those if I hit close now you can see we've got a line [0:37:24]
 along the same plane at this circle that's the reason why I've jubicated it because it takes the [0:37:30]
 placement with it look at the position rate point five there now when we click on that profile [0:37:40]
 this one here and use the revolve we can select the reference and select this line and come down [0:37:48]
 and change the angle to 90 degrees and here okay at the moment it's gone the wrong way [0:37:58]
 so click on the revolve and we can set this to minus 90 and hit enter and now we're following [0:38:08]
 the right curve so we've got that curve running up there now for the holes in here [0:38:16]
 well we could add that to our sketch so we're looking for the sketch for the astrude [0:38:22]
 and I'll click on this astrude this one here this sketch has happened to here [0:38:29]
 and we'll create circle and this was three millimeters [0:38:36]
 and we set the distance from here to here five mil and the same for the height [0:38:47]
 so we're doing exactly the same thing but I'm adding it to the sketch instead of [0:38:55]
 creating another sketch on that face there [0:38:59]
 smedge core cross there and we'll keep those in line that one in that one in the line and we also need [0:39:11]
 a height to find the strangle tool down a five mil and close that that [0:39:21]
 cross those holes so now we're done that's join these all together so now click [0:39:27]
 the strude control click the other strude so you can see the highlights in here and [0:39:32]
 the control click revolve now we need to come to part and boolean those together with a union [0:39:40]
 so those are all one fusion let's do our finishing before we mirror this so we take [0:39:48]
 these circles control click them part shumfa and you can see the edges that have been selected [0:40:00]
 so we've got two edges there one millimeters shumfa okay that and then we're slet these edges [0:40:09]
 control set those part fill it four millimeters in the radius of fillet there we go and then we want [0:40:20]
 to take these and we're just fillet these off as well wherever one millimeter fillet [0:40:25]
 and we'll come up to here and use a fillet on there for one millimeter and okay [0:40:31]
 so we've got that there click the fillet part mirroring mirroring over the [0:40:42]
 YZ plane so you can see the YZ plane here and we want to flip it over that one okay [0:40:51]
 now we've got our mirrored part aside which will be embedded inside [0:40:59]
 this mirror here so we've got the original fillet and the mirror we need to control click those [0:41:05]
 and I have a do one of two things we can make a compound make compound all we could use the boolean [0:41:15]
 and union those together in a single fusion we now got this one and if we want to we can [0:41:22]
 refine this to true to get rid of this line here because this is two faces and the same plane [0:41:29]
 that can be joined together and we finished our model so that's how you would do that in the part [0:41:37]
 and part design workbench we can be looking at the part workbench in more detail in our next video [0:41:45]
 where we go through the boolean operations in there and show you some ways of using that [0:41:51]
