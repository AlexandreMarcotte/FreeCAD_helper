===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 15 - Making Curved Shapes With Boolean Intersections =====
 I have one in welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of the Learning [0:00:04]
 Free CAD for beginners. We're teaching the fundamentals of free CAD from a beginner's [0:00:08]
 perspective while we understand and learn workflows. In this tutorial I'm going to help you [0:00:13]
 visualize how it will create more complex part and the actions we take to create the part [0:00:19]
 from Boolean operations. In this case we're using intersections. So I'm going to show you a physical [0:00:25]
 object and then we're going to do a part workflow and explain with that object the operations [0:00:32]
 we take to create that for. As well as understand the Boolean operation for the intersection, [0:00:37]
 you'll give your way of thinking about your objects so you can determine the workflow that [0:00:42]
 you need to complete your model. So I hope you enjoy these videos and that's how we look [0:00:47]
 at this technique. If you like we have seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a [0:00:52]

 be used to span the channel. So good example of the workflow that we use with Boolean [0:01:16]
 is something like modeling a fork or even a spoon. So I've got both of these here. [0:01:25]
 Now to do this if we take this fork for example we wouldn't attack it from the top [0:01:32]
 straightaway. It looks quite a complex model to tackle but it is quite simple. If we flip [0:01:39]
 this way and what we want to do is look at the profile. So this is the first thing that [0:01:47]
 you will sketch out. So this profile here. After that when we actually sketch this out and [0:01:53]
 the student we get this astusion. So this shape here going forwards. Once this goes forwards [0:02:01]
 then we can tack it from this way. So looking at any curvature that's coming around here. [0:02:09]
 And then we add this to the model and we'll probably change the model to something like [0:02:14]
 a sweep or a loft to get our curvature. We're still only dealing with the profile from the [0:02:20]
 side and the curvature from the front. So what you'll end up with is basically a rectangle [0:02:25]
 around this bounding box of the fork. Once we get that curvature you may not end up with [0:02:33]
 any curvature this way. So it may be just a straight astrude along here going this direction. [0:02:42]
 Then we can tackle the above and this is where the booning features come in. So we would [0:02:47]
 actually sketch this shape out and then astrude this forwards. And that's extruded through [0:02:55]
 the shape which has done before. So this is two astrudes with this one and the shape [0:03:00]
 before we would use an intersection and this will create the shape that we need. Let's take [0:03:09]
 this spoon. We've got the same thing if we look to this side we have the profile. But you can [0:03:19]
 see straight away we have this curvature. So bring it around this way we've got the curvature [0:03:24]
 of the spoon going this way. So there's two ways to tackle this. We can create a profile. [0:03:31]
 Going along this way which will be a path for a sweep and create curves this way and [0:03:39]
 along here it will still be a rectangle. So we're going to rounder in box. So there [0:03:46]
 will still be a rectangle. But we'll have the curvature there. Then we can create the intersection [0:03:53]
 with or we take the profile this one and create multiple profiles going this way. So we [0:04:03]
 create our first profile. Then we create another profile that takes into account this middle [0:04:11]
 curvature. And then we create our last profile which is basically a copy of this because it sits [0:04:18]
 on this side, the underneath side. So come around this side, sits on this side. We then [0:04:26]
 loft or sweep across those. Going this way and then we bring this around this side and [0:04:33]
 then draw our shape. The strew to that through the loft this way and then create the [0:04:42]
 intersection through both pieces. So that's look at tackling the fork. We're going to [0:04:51]
 be using the part workflow. So in the sketch, first we're going to create our first sketch [0:04:56]
 and create a new document and create our first sketch. Now we're looking at the profile [0:05:02]
 from the side. So this will be the YZ plane. So this one here. I'm going to use a B spline. [0:05:12]
 We can use the endpoint room point arcs or any arcs we want to but I'm going to use a [0:05:17]
 B spline just to keep it easier. And I'm going to sketch the curvature of the fork, the [0:05:22]
 neck and then the handle. Something like this. Hit escape. Now we've got that curvature [0:05:29]
 in there. We can make some finer adjustments. And bring this across. And we're just [0:05:42]
 roughing out the fork in there. You can take more time to do this. We're just getting [0:05:48]
 that fork shape in there. Now it's worth keeping a note of where the hatch will head [0:05:53]
 start. So the head of the fork. So these will be the prongs and this will be the head. [0:05:59]
 And this is where we want to have some kind of reference in here for our top sketch to look [0:06:06]
 down because our neck of that fork when it comes round should line up with the top sketch [0:06:13]
 as well to get our curvature correct. Now the fork is quite easy because it hasn't got [0:06:17]
 any curvature. It has a curvature going this way. So we have our fork. And I'm going to [0:06:25]
 screw this forwards. Now I can make this a figure object by adding another line that follows [0:06:31]
 this if I want. But I'm going to do is going to the part where bench. We now need to [0:06:36]
 screw this. So first of all we click the sketch and click the astute. We need to add some [0:06:45]
 thickness to this. So this is the thickness of the fork. So I'm going to be a screwed in it [0:06:49]
 along with that. And if we look to the customer direction said so we're using the customer [0:06:57]
 actions for this and we'll change this to around about 2 mil. So we're screwed it this [0:07:03]
 way. Now we want to screw it to make the length going this way. So you can extrude [0:07:11]
 it in the extrude. So click on the astute and get ourselves orientated so we want to extrude [0:07:18]
 along the x. So click a astute. Custom direction which is x got one in there and this is going [0:07:26]
 to be the length because we can be sketching above this. So we're going to go from a like [0:07:31]
 60 millimeters. It doesn't matter how long that is and make it symmetrical. So we're [0:07:37]
 screwing out this way and this way with symmetry. Let's hit OK. We've got that astusion in there. [0:07:44]
 It may seem a bit large but this is perfect for what we want. So we look at the top. [0:07:51]
 We can start sketching our fork in here. Now I haven't done any curvature this way because [0:07:57]
 there's no need to with this fork as we saw before. It hasn't gotten any curvature this [0:08:01]
 way. If I was doing this for the spoon then I would. So let's bring this around this way. [0:08:07]
 I think you see what we've got there. Click on top and we'll create enough sketch. Make [0:08:15]
 sure enough it's selected. Come over to the sketcher and click on the sketch icon. Go [0:08:25]
 on all that swipe plane and hit OK. So let's just around but you can see how that's been [0:08:30]
 positioned there. We want to move the sketch above this. So we're not intercepting through [0:08:36]
 this otherwise we're going to get it self-confused and we need to see this underneath. [0:08:41]
 Click on that sketch. Look at the placement and we want to move it because it's not [0:08:48]
 attached anywhere. And we can see the axis there along the z axis. So position z and move that [0:08:58]
 up all the way up to the top so it's sitting above there. So that means that no view [0:09:07]
 section will actually remove any of this below. Now we can start sketching the fork in here. [0:09:14]
 This is the reason why we went symmetrical because when we did this, strewed our shape [0:09:21]
 was sitting along here and geometry and we're strewed it out this way and this way. This [0:09:27]
 means I can just sketch one half the fork. So let's start sketching that fork in here. [0:09:33]
 I'm going to use the curtain art by its endpoint and ROOM point. So this one here. And we [0:09:39]
 got to look to see where the neck is. So our neck is about here. So we may want place [0:09:45]
 of reference on here just to get an idea of that neck is. So that's place of line. So across [0:09:52]
 here and this will be construction geometry. And we look to the right. We can see so at the [0:10:01]
 moment it's sitting here which is more or less right. So that's fine. So that might [0:10:08]
 that construction geometry. So we're going to idea of where the neck should be. And we're [0:10:15]
 constrained that from here and place a length in here. You notice this I haven't actually [0:10:19]
 used any lengths in here. We're just demonstrating the techniques. So we say that's 35. [0:10:26]
 So this is where the actual prongs will be and the neck will start here. So let's get the [0:10:33]
 neck in. End point and ROOM point arc and we'll create an arc. Something like that. [0:10:41]
 And the second arc will be something like this. And our prongs will be long here somewhere. [0:10:53]
 So here's a scape and just bring this out a bit further. So now we've got that in there. [0:10:59]
 That's assuming. And start to create the prongs. So I'm going to use the pulley line. I'm [0:11:04]
 going to come in to about here. Coming out and connect up like so. It's scape. It's [0:11:11]
 going to bring this in. Make sure that this line. Now let's see where we are. We've got the [0:11:19]
 top. So this is actually going to be horizontal like that. Now we've got create one more. [0:11:27]
 So input and input and input and arc. It's create a small arc in here. [0:11:34]
 Like so. And create the prong. So we're going to use a pulley line again. Connect up to the arc. [0:11:42]
 Come out. We'll place that in line in minutes. And let's come back. Like so. Let's [0:11:52]
 make all these. Place them in line. There we go. There's a line. Remember around this [0:11:59]
 way. So a bit confusing. And we'll do the same with these two. So we've got the starts [0:12:08]
 of our fork. I'm going to take this. Hold it. And then click that center line. Got to [0:12:18]
 sketch. Sketch tools. And then symmetry. Good logic at the moment. We'll can place all of [0:12:28]
 these in line with whichever. And I'm going to bring this around. Let's bring around this [0:12:32]
 way. So we can see what we're doing. And do this properly. Those in line. And we've [0:12:39]
 got all these. Need to be in line. So I'm going to take these. Place those in line. [0:12:50]
 We're going to under constraint there. Just delete those. So all those will move. And [0:13:05]
 then come down to the bottom and place those in line. Top still move. So those need to [0:13:18]
 be in line as well. So I'm going to take these two points as well for the other arcs. Place [0:13:22]
 those in line. And we'll take all these. So this one, this one. And this one. Place [0:13:29]
 those in line as well. Got some redundancy there. Let's click on that. Hit delete. So we've [0:13:35]
 got some moving back and forth there. See those moving. These arcs should be a cool. Now [0:13:53]
 we're going to do just bring these in. So these two. And place an arc in there. It's [0:14:05]
 going to take this point and this line. And we'll put a point on line constraint there. [0:14:11]
 So we've got starts of our fork. Maybe a bit big, but it's just getting idea of how to do [0:14:16]
 this. Let's place an arc in here as well. Bring this out. And we'll place that point [0:14:24]
 on this line. Point the line constraint or point object constraint. Bring these in. And [0:14:33]
 we can decide where this is going to go. So let's bring that in this way. And take this [0:14:41]
 arc and this curve. Might as well tangent. Okay, that's so we've got to start with our [0:14:51]
 fork there. It's a bit large, but gets an idea of how we're going to do this. Now what [0:14:59]
 we do is we're screwed this. So come over to the part web edge. Click on the sketch. [0:15:07]
 What the fork. Screw it. And set this to some size. It's going to allow us to a [0:15:12]
 straight right away from here. So I'm going to go 100 millimeters. It's going to go upwards. [0:15:17]
 So that's come into that astrude. And come down and set it to reverse. Or we can move this [0:15:26]
 down. So you can see that we've got those two astrudes there. It's a bit over the top. [0:15:32]
 But it emphasizes what we're trying to do. Now we add the Boolean intersection. Take one [0:15:39]
 astrude. I want there. Control click the other. So come up to part Boolean and then intersection. [0:15:50]
 We now have our fork. It's built on chunky side. It shows you how that's actually produced. [0:15:59]
 Who's left? We've got the common in there. Inside the two astrudes. Inside that sketch. [0:16:05]
 And the astrudes. And the other sketch. So you can see that other sketch. Go through there. [0:16:18]
 Let's just control click those and hide those. So that's the fork done. So that's how [0:16:29]
 look at the part where the flow for creating the spoon. We're going to do something different here. [0:16:33]
 We're going to create a closed sketch. To rather create an offset to create the thickness. [0:16:38]
 We're going to create the top and bottom skin to create a solid rather than a surface. The reason [0:16:44]
 been is because sometimes when we'd loft, which will be using in this workflow, we sometimes [0:16:50]
 can't use an offset in there. It all failed. So for safety, we will create a closed sketch to create [0:16:56]
 a solid profile. I'm in the sketch. I'm a create sketch. I'm going to go along the [0:17:01]
 YZ plane because we do it in the profile along the side of the spoon. Now remember back to the [0:17:07]
 spoon. We're looking at three profiles. The left and right one I'm going to be saying. The middle [0:17:12]
 one's going to have the curved trural. So I'm going to use an endpoint and root point arc to create [0:17:20]
 the spoon profile. We're going to come in and just create a small profile like so. And I might [0:17:27]
 take this point and this point can I close together. And then I'm going to use a bee spline. [0:17:34]
 It's a great handle. So we're attaching to this point and we'll create a handle like so. [0:17:41]
 And here's a scape. And we're going to just this handle to get the curvature [0:17:50]
 and the look and feel that we want. Watch out for tangency coming across here because we want to make [0:18:03]
 flowing throughout the sketch. So something like this so you can see we've got a nice [0:18:09]
 flow through there. I'm not too buffer about the scale of this. It's just showing the technique. [0:18:18]
 So we've got the first part of our profile but we need the top and bottom and we'll close it at the [0:18:25]
 size to create our close sketch. To do that I'm going to highlight the whole lot. [0:18:30]
 So first of all we highlight it using click and drag. Now we've got to choose a point because [0:18:40]
 I'm going to copy this but it's going to copy and be positioned by the last point that we selected. [0:18:47]
 So for instance, here's point here if I select it once and then select the gains of [0:18:51]
 unselected it and then select it. That becomes the last point that we selected. That means when we come [0:18:56]
 up to the sketch, sketch tools and copy we get a line that we can position that and we get the [0:19:05]
 constraints as well so you can see we've got a vertical constraint there. So we can go from this [0:19:11]
 point if we look down to the bottom notice the last measurement there is zero millimeters and we can [0:19:19]
 come up and decide I want this something like 2.5 and when we click we get that there. That's [0:19:29]
 zoom in and create a arc between these two. So again use the end point and then point arc [0:19:37]
 off over this point I've got the order constraints on the void redundant constraints there. [0:19:44]
 So click, quinsing constraint, click quinsing constraint and bring this around. I'm going to take [0:19:53]
 this arc and this arc and make those tangent to each other. We get the substitution that's now [0:20:01]
 tangent. I do the same with the bottom one. I'll place the tangent here across there. [0:20:06]
 Then I take these two points and use a distance and set this 2.5 millimeters [0:20:16]
 as coming to this one now and what we're going to do is take this point and this point [0:20:24]
 and place them vertical length gain of 2.5 millimeters. Moving along we can see we've got this [0:20:35]
 point here which needs an arc between here and here and point a room point arc. Bring this arc around [0:20:43]
 and we can create a tangency between a beast line and an arc here so we have to eyeball this into position [0:20:52]
 or considering this is quite straight here I'm just going to take these two and place [0:20:59]
 and length of 2.5 and I'm also going to take these two and place them in [0:21:08]
 vertical constraint to each other. So these still can be pulled away from each other, [0:21:16]
 I'll draw those at that. Now we can take these two, place a height 2.5. [0:21:25]
 So you can see as I move that that moves and keeps that distance away. [0:21:35]
 Now we're a peak with these two points. [0:21:39]
 Memorine the vertical constraint and we'll set. So as you can see if I move this one [0:21:58]
 we get that nice constraint there. So here controls that to get back to where it was before. [0:22:10]
 So we've got one profile of the spoon done. We're going to take these two points, [0:22:15]
 keep the vertical line and also take these two zoom in, set a height of 2.5 [0:22:27]
 That means now I can draw the culture of this. This is moving back and forth so I may want to [0:22:36]
 fix that. But you can see how we can strain this right down. Let's close that now. [0:22:44]
 We've got our first profile. We're going to duplicate this two times. Click on the sketch, [0:22:53]
 edit, duplicate selection, then edit, duplicate selection again. This one is going to be the [0:23:02]
 middle one. So we right click rename and call this mid sketch. This one's going to be left, [0:23:14]
 right click rename, let's sketch and this one's going to be the right. [0:23:22]
 So the right sketch. The left one we've got to send it this way. So look down at the placement. [0:23:31]
 I'll click on the left sketch position and we're going to transform that along the x position [0:23:40]
 and this is where the width of the spoon comes in. So I'm going to keep this slightly bigger so [0:23:46]
 it looks quite chunky. So get an idea of what it looks like. So we're going to set this to 20 millimeters. [0:23:52]
 To the right sketch position x, we'll do this one is 20. [0:23:59]
 So we can see that in there. Let's bring these down a bit. So that's two, this one's 15 and this one [0:24:08]
 has 15. That means that when we loft through these, the middle of that loft will be here. [0:24:19]
 So if I come up to a few toggle access cross, you can see the middle of that loft is there. [0:24:26]
 So any sketches we have, the middle of the sketch will be here as well. [0:24:30]
 Let's come around to the right and bring this around so we can see that there. [0:24:37]
 Now if we look, we're just going to get a solid loft from here to here. [0:24:44]
 Our spoon curves in the middle so we've got curvature here. [0:24:49]
 So we can do this either before or after we've loft. We did this after what would happen. [0:24:56]
 We can move it to part and make sure nothing is selected. Come on to part. [0:25:03]
 Loft is going to ask us for the profiles. Does it matter which way round you play sees as long as [0:25:12]
 the middle ones the second one you put. So right sketch move that over to select profiles, [0:25:18]
 middle sketch move that over also left sketch. [0:25:21]
 Because we've got closed profile we can hit create solid and hit OK. We've now got our loft. [0:25:31]
 And you can see what we're going to do. We're going to place the spoon shape upon here [0:25:37]
 and do an intersection. But we need to deal with this center profile. [0:25:44]
 Going to loft and come down to the mid sketch and double clicker. We've got that now. [0:25:52]
 We need to curve this downwards. So I'm going to control that with the curvature here. [0:26:00]
 And we can bring this down and you can see underneath it the other sketches sitting there. [0:26:07]
 And we can decide how far we want this to come down. So using your spoon as a reference we can [0:26:15]
 decide on that. I might bring this out slightly as well. Because if you think about it we're going [0:26:20]
 to place the spoon here and it's going to shut out into that middle point there. [0:26:25]
 So we're bringing this over here so it's out the way and we can decide where this is going to go. [0:26:33]
 Just watch out for the tangency here we may want to release this point from the center point so we can [0:26:41]
 keep tangency. That's it close. So you can see the curvature we got there. [0:26:49]
 Now this comes to the top and it's best to bring us around in line with the top. So we've got our [0:26:59]
 vertical and horizontal alignments the same as our scene and kind of to the sketch. [0:27:05]
 We're going to create a new sketch so make sure nothing's selected and create new. [0:27:11]
 This is looking down and this is going to be the profile of the spoon looking down onto the [0:27:17]
 spoon just from the edge of the way up here. Okay. Now we start sketching the spoon. [0:27:21]
 First thing that we must be aware of, we come around, is that this sketch has to be pulled upwards. [0:27:30]
 So it sits above the loft. Click on top and kind of the model. Click on the sketch. [0:27:38]
 We're looking along the z-plane so here and start moving the sketch upwards. [0:27:48]
 So it sits on top. We know this line here is around about the neck of this spoon. [0:27:59]
 So we can use that in our sketching. That's coming and start the sketching. [0:28:05]
 I'm going to hide the loft, click on the loft and hide it because I've got these guidelines here. [0:28:10]
 And I'm going to start sketching in the spoon so I'm going to use the endpoint and [0:28:16]
 the endpoint arc. And we'll do one side of the spoon and use symmetry to bring this around to the [0:28:26]
 other side. So that's creating arc and we could bring this arc all the way to here. It's creating [0:28:33]
 enough arc and this is going to be the neck so I'm looking at the center point around about [0:28:43]
 center point arc for that in place. I'm going to point it up on the arc onto that line. [0:28:47]
 Point on object constraint so we've got that there. And we can bring this in and decide where it's [0:28:53]
 going to go. Now we need the rest of the spoon here again another arc coming around and [0:29:05]
 placing this around like so. And bring this out and we can change the curvature [0:29:12]
 trying to keep it in line. So making sure it doesn't spill out the front. [0:29:21]
 This is the reason why we pushed this profile forwards and with profile forwards. [0:29:30]
 Let's bring this back. So now we've got that. I've got it happy with that. [0:29:39]
 I'm going to highlight all these again. This time I'm using symmetry. So click for the last one, [0:29:46]
 the vertical line. I've got sketched tools and then use symmetry to place that symmetric here across [0:29:54]
 that line. We'll use these two points and also use symmetry constraint against this [0:29:59]
 center line. Symmetry is there. Same with these two and the center line symmetry. [0:30:06]
 And work our way down using symmetry across all those points just to make our life a bit easier. [0:30:15]
 One more up here. We've got close the spoon as well. [0:30:20]
 I mean if we move one of these, this moves in worse American control what this looks like so [0:30:30]
 can get the shape that we want and it's just being mirrored over the other side. [0:30:35]
 Now let's have a look at this. So I need to add curvature onto this end here using [0:30:44]
 endpoint and RunePoint arc. Those two and just bring this around like so. [0:30:50]
 Take the point to keep it on this line. The points on line is straight that. [0:30:56]
 Ultimately it makes that symmetrical. And we may just be out there. So that one there, [0:31:06]
 looking bringing in this geometry if we want so we can input this geometry. [0:31:11]
 To understand where that sits. So we can highlight that, bring that in. You can see that point there. [0:31:19]
 So that sits almost upon that point. [0:31:21]
 If you're just good, let's move up to the top. Zoom in and add our final arc. [0:31:34]
 So we have our spoon. It's going to task and close up. [0:31:45]
 So we have our spoon and underneath the profiles of the loft. [0:31:52]
 Let's bring back the loft. Hide those sketches within there because we don't need those now. [0:31:58]
 There's the same process. We've got the spoon sketch at the top. We've got the loft at the bottom. [0:32:04]
 Make sure enough it's selected. Go over to the part where bench. [0:32:07]
 We'll do our stout. We'll have the stout downwards. Take that sketch of the top profile. [0:32:15]
 Stout. And we're going to send it downwards through the z axis, which is normal to this sketch. [0:32:24]
 Z axis runs this way. We need reverse. And we'll do this. We'll have no idea how far this goes down. [0:32:35]
 So let's do this for 60. Let's see how far that gets us. So let's push that right away. [0:32:42]
 Pass there. Now this is where we looked. It's made sure that this is stued. If we look at [0:32:49]
 the bottom of the top, that is being encapsulated by that loft, which it has. [0:32:55]
 Now it's just a case of doing the intersection. Take the loft. Control-click the [0:33:04]
 astrude or we can do it from the screen. It doesn't matter which way around you do it. [0:33:10]
 If we're all lofted, it's true. It's true. Loft. Cut to the part. We want the boolean operations [0:33:17]
 and we want the intersection. And we have our finished spoon. If we've got some problems here so you [0:33:24]
 can see we've got this dip going along here. Then we can come into the loft and just have a look [0:33:33]
 to see what's going on. So we can see how that's curved over there. And we can adjust this. [0:33:47]
 So we can move this curve up if we wanted to. I'll move this back away from here just to get rid of [0:33:53]
 that totally up to you. We're going to see if I took that intersection. And this is a zoom out [0:34:00]
 and move this forwards. I can hear clothes. You can see we've got rid of that there. [0:34:09]
 Just make sure we haven't damaged the bottom and we've got to adjust the strude. [0:34:16]
 It might be a hole in the bottom but that's how to create that spoon. [0:34:22]
 With all those profiles. I'll just hide the axis cross. So that's the power of intersections. [0:34:34]
