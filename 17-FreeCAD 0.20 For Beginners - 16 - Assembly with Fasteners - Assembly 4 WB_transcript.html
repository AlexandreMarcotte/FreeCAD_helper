===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 16 - Assembly with Fasteners - Assembly 4 WB =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to another episode of the Learning Freak Have For Beginners, [0:00:04]
 where we teach the fundamentals of free CAD with practical examples, [0:00:08]
 once we learn workflows. Today we're going to be looking at assembly 4 and also the [0:00:13]
 Fasteners workbench. We're going to be learning how to create an assembly by using both [0:00:18]
 a part design and a part object. Now with both those workflows we can produce a number of [0:00:26]
 bodies and parts to use in our assembly. By importing those into assembly 4 workflow and also using [0:00:34]
 the Fasteners workbench, we can create those part design and parts with different fasteners that [0:00:41]
 connect those all together. With this demonstration we're going to be making something simple like this, [0:00:45]
 which gives you the beginnings of understanding the assembly for workbench and also understanding [0:00:52]
 how to add fasteners in there. We can be understanding the local and how to import part design [0:01:00]
 and part workbench parts into the same assembly. So I hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a [0:01:06]
 look at these workbenches and this workflow. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. [0:01:11]
 I also have a co-fire or a coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that's at [0:01:17]
 kho-hifinfi.com, 4 slash mhn-j-0, also run a patreon where you can subscribe and get extra content. [0:01:26]
 And that's at www.pictureon.com, 4 slash mango jelly solutions. Any money that's currently donated [0:01:32]
 will be used to span the channel. So the first thing we're going to do is actually install the [0:01:36]
 assembly for and the fasteners workbench. To do that we come up to tools and into the addon manager. [0:01:44]
 And in here we can use the filter to find the necessary work benches. So the first one I'm going to [0:01:50]
 install is the assembly for. So search it by assembly for and there it is to here. [0:01:56]
 This allows us to take part design parts and part parts. I know the assembly is an assembly [0:02:04]
 and we're just installing that and what I do is just download it and install it. [0:02:10]
 And we've got success there. Let's go back and also install the fasteners workbench. [0:02:17]
 Here's fasteners and this gives you a number of ISO standard fasteners m6, m8, etc. [0:02:26]
 In nuts, screws, bolts, etc. So we can just install that. [0:02:31]
 And these do work together as well. [0:02:34]
 Once we're installed we can close this annual access to restart free cat. [0:02:41]
 And we just do restart now. Now we have the two weapons installed we can start our project. [0:02:46]
 I'm creating new document and come over to the part design. I'm going to be using the part as well. [0:02:53]
 But just going to first design a small clip in the part design. [0:02:58]
 I'm going to start by creating a body and creating a sketch. [0:03:02]
 Now this only needs one extrusion and one pocket. So I'm going to look at this from the accept plane. [0:03:11]
 Now we're on the accept plane to start sketching. I'm going to use a line. [0:03:19]
 Go to the cross the bottom. [0:03:22]
 Go redundant constraint. Let's delete that. [0:03:27]
 And then I'm going to use the arctel. We're going to go for the center and end point arc. [0:03:32]
 And I'm just going to constrain it to this line and we'll come up to our here and we're create our arct. [0:03:44]
 Like so. I'm going to use the polyline and I'm going to connect up these points [0:03:50]
 to that arct by placing a vertical and in a horizontal we're put constrain in that moment. [0:03:57]
 I'll set a skate and let's do the same over this side as well. [0:04:01]
 So connecting up those. [0:04:04]
 Glue the alt constraints on. As you can see on the left hand side here and I'm going to use [0:04:11]
 the vertical constraint. I just add one to there. [0:04:14]
 Go to the left and add one to here and then I'm using the horizontal constraint and add it [0:04:22]
 nice to there as well to those. [0:04:24]
 Hit skate from do some accord here across these two. [0:04:29]
 Those equal and also across these two and lines as well. [0:04:36]
 Now we've got those in. We can put some length across here. So that's place of length. [0:04:46]
 I'm going to add a 10mm length in that. [0:04:50]
 Left across here of 60mm. [0:04:54]
 Zoom in a bit and need to know the constraints by dragging them out. [0:05:03]
 And we'll place a height in here or three millimeters. [0:05:10]
 We've got this arc. Backhand, change the height. So I'm going to take off this line. [0:05:16]
 We're clicking on this point to the line constraint. Click that. [0:05:19]
 We're going to place this point on this point and use a quinstant constraint. [0:05:24]
 Also going to add another arc. I can't see the arc. Now what we're doing is just creating a circular [0:05:31]
 clip. I'm going to attach it to this line. Bring it out. It's going to be in line with this one. [0:05:36]
 But we're going to do that in a minute and place an arc in there. [0:05:39]
 So I'm going to take these two points and these two points and place those in line. [0:05:47]
 Delete the redundant constraint and then we've got this arc here which we can set [0:05:55]
 to allow us to create this thickness of the wall. I'm going to use a line to join up this point [0:06:03]
 and the base. Like so. [0:06:07]
 And here's a skate and place vertical constraint and just use these two to set the width. [0:06:17]
 And so that's a three millimeter. So we've got this so far. I'm going to take these two points. [0:06:25]
 Make those quinstant and we just delete that redundant constraint. We just start [0:06:31]
 point online constraint there. Just delete that and we've got that inner wall there. [0:06:36]
 I'm going to remove this line here. We're just in trim it. So I'm going to use the trim tool [0:06:42]
 to image and just remove that out. Now we can take these two. Make the meek wall. [0:06:49]
 Now you can still see we've got some problems. It's not connected to this line here. So I can take this [0:06:59]
 point and this line point online constraint and we're all constraint down. [0:07:04]
 So that's how clip done all we need to do is take that sketch and add a pad of 10 millimeters. [0:07:15]
 Let's keep with 10. Okay. Now I'm going to come around to the top and add a sketch. [0:07:22]
 We'll put on this pad. So this face here this is going to be the hole. So that's a sketch. [0:07:25]
 Now what we're doing coming and we're going to bring in these cool points. If I can get in here [0:07:33]
 it doesn't matter if we bring in the line. It's just these cool points and the same on the other side. [0:07:38]
 And these are going to be used for symmetry when we add our circle. I've bought in that line but [0:07:44]
 it doesn't matter. We can add two circles. You decide because these are on the same plane. [0:07:50]
 Means that I can sketch or one face and the sketch wall also allowing to use the other face as well. [0:07:58]
 Let's take these two points and do symmetry across here. The best idea is to select the symmetry [0:08:05]
 tool first because we've got two to do this across and then we can do this in basically less clicks. [0:08:13]
 Take these two points and that's symmetrical point. Now symmetrical tool is still [0:08:19]
 activated so we take these two and that one and then we can hit a scape. [0:08:26]
 Let's get a mouse point back. Let's let both those circles and then set the radius. [0:08:32]
 Now I'm going to set that to five mil. So this is going to be a five millimeter hole in here so [0:08:37]
 we're going to need a five millimeter fastener as well. Let's close that. As you can see those holes [0:08:44]
 are ready to pocket. Take the sketch and then use the pocket and dimensions we just need [0:08:55]
 three millimeters because this is three millimeters as specified in the sketch for this line here [0:09:01]
 and here okay. We now go out part done. Now one thing I'm going to do is hide the axis cross. [0:09:12]
 So it can come out a few, come down to toggle axis cross and turn that off. Now there is a reason for this [0:09:20]
 because we're going to be adding something called an LCS and a local call to the system to this [0:09:25]
 to allow us to align and place this in the assembly for workbench. So let's prepare this part for [0:09:31]
 assembly. I'm going to use the assembly for workbench. First of all on this part. Now we're in the [0:09:39]
 assembly for workbench. I need to add that local call system to this body. So click the body. [0:09:46]
 Go up to assembly. Crank datamol jet. New call system. And we're just going to call this something [0:09:57]
 like LCS origin. So what this does it allows me to place this in my assembly. We're going to be placing [0:10:08]
 more call systems to this object to place the fastener so that the moment has to attach [0:10:14]
 school system somewhere. And I'm just going to pick this inner arc. So this one here. [0:10:21]
 So you can see it's come up circle pocket edge 14. And we've got a call system in there. [0:10:31]
 Remember where this arc sits. So the origin of this arc is actually attached to the origin of [0:10:39]
 the sketch which is here. This point here. Okay we've got our local call system in there. [0:10:46]
 This is the reason why disabled the access cross because you can get it easily mixed up with the [0:10:51]
 access cross. So this allows us to connect it to our assembly. We can save that now. [0:10:58]
 And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to use my desktop and create a new folder in here. [0:11:08]
 Now it's going to call it down by assembly. Because I want to place everything in the same folder [0:11:16]
 so it's easy to find. And we call this clip. So this is our first part. [0:11:27]
 Now the important thing here is that we're using a body. So we're using the body in the [0:11:35]
 part design. If we were using a part, we use the part, the standard part. Look up here. We can see we've got [0:11:42]
 new body and new part. So this is the part design. And this is the part web edge parts. [0:11:50]
 And we can actually import into there. So as long as the part is within this container, the same [0:11:56]
 as the part design, in a body, then we can import them into our assembly. We haven't actually [0:12:02]
 ported anything into our assembly yet, which is created apart in there. So that's create another [0:12:08]
 part for our assembly. This time we're going to use the part web edge. So showing how you can [0:12:14]
 swap between these workflows. I could do this in the same document or I could do it in a new one. [0:12:23]
 I'm going to start a new document. You can see we've still got the clip open there and we've got our [0:12:29]
 access cross in the middle. You can turn that off. Talk about the access cross if you want. I've [0:12:34]
 got this set as default. Now I'm going to create something, now I'm going to create something that [0:12:41]
 I can include in the assembly. I'm going to keep it simple and come over to the sketcher and create [0:12:48]
 simple sketch in here. So new sketch. This time I'm going to apply in OK that. And we're going to [0:12:56]
 add a rectangle. Take these two points, make this symmetrical to this point. Use the symmetry. [0:13:06]
 Set length, let's say 80 and a height. So 10 millimeters. And that's place a circle in here. That's [0:13:19]
 going to be the whole roundabout here. Actually, this set this height to something else. So I'm going [0:13:26]
 to double click that and set that to roundabout 12 mil. And we'll set this one down to around about [0:13:35]
 five millimeters. Coming in the sets, the position of this roundabout five millimeters away. [0:13:47]
 And close that. And all we're going to do is come over to the part workbench. [0:13:52]
 And just a stroke that by about three millimeters. So we've got something to work with. [0:14:00]
 Now I'll go back to what we said about the assembly. This stroke or your finished fusion or finished [0:14:09]
 Boolean needs to be in a stand-up part. To play sign a stand-up part, if we look along the toolbar, [0:14:16]
 it might be a different position for you. You'll see this great part. [0:14:19]
 Croats and new part makes it active. If I click on that, we get this part in here. [0:14:25]
 Any new actions will be added to that part. As you can see, it's ultimately been added to that part. [0:14:34]
 Now we'll hit. So that's how I like those and hit the lead. You can move things into that part [0:14:42]
 by just clicking on it and moving that astute and dragging it into that part. So that's the name [0:14:50]
 this part. I'm just going to call this rectangle. Right-handle part. So we've got our strue [0:15:02]
 there and I'll go and save it and save it into the demo assembly as right-handle. [0:15:12]
 So now we have all the parts we need. I've still got the two project files open. [0:15:21]
 Nice to there. So I'm now going to create a new file and this is going to be the assembly file. [0:15:30]
 Let's come over to the assembly workbench assembly for. I can come up to the assembly [0:15:37]
 and click on new model. This starts at our model. We get parts and model and inside here. [0:15:45]
 You can see we've got a number of different icons, including local horn and the system. [0:15:52]
 And this is the reason why I disable this access cross because we can't really see it. [0:15:56]
 Let's do that. To glasses crossed to turn that off. So this local horn system will connect to [0:16:04]
 our first part. Everything else that we add to the scene will be connected to that part, [0:16:11]
 which we just added. If we also look on the assembly for, we'll see this icon here which is the [0:16:16]
 fastness workbench add-on. So this is added. This icon here. There is also a fastness workbench. [0:16:24]
 As you can see here, that we can use as well. But in the assembly for it it gets added as [0:16:31]
 a little icon. One going to do now with this unnamed document is actually save it. So file, save, [0:16:38]
 and replace it in our demo assembly folder. And call this one assembly. [0:16:44]
 Now we can start adding our parts. To do that, I'm going to come up to assembly [0:16:52]
 and come down to import parts. Or we can use the icon from the toolbar. [0:16:59]
 Notice this week got our tabs already open. So we've got all the models already open. [0:17:05]
 And we can just come in to import part. And we get the two parts here that we can actually import. [0:17:12]
 So we've got unnamed body and unnamed rectangle part there. The reason why I say it unnamed [0:17:18]
 is because we haven't actually closed these documents yet. For cancel out and close these. [0:17:24]
 So we've closed the clip and the rectangle. If I try to open now, it says that there's nothing in [0:17:34]
 our actual document. Nothing available. So we can go open file. And I can bring in the clip. [0:17:41]
 Now if not, we get the clip body. Click on the clip body. And we will name [0:17:48]
 for the link as clip. So what we're doing is actually linking the models to our assembly. [0:17:54]
 And then click insert. Our model is now inserted. And you'll notice it's on the left hand side that [0:18:02]
 we've got this panel here. So this one here. And this is place link part. There's an icon on this toolbar [0:18:10]
 that we actually bring this back up and edit our parts. So I've actually left off certain corner [0:18:16]
 systems that I'm going to add back into the model to show you that process. You'll also notice [0:18:22]
 it's done the bottom here. We have this tab. That's that model that's been added to the assembly. [0:18:26]
 So a left here, you've got a tach too. So if we drop this down, we need to set this to parent assembly. [0:18:34]
 Now you notice what's happened. In our columns here, the two lists, we've got the LCS origin [0:18:42]
 of the clip. And the LCS origin of that model we've imported. So let both of those [0:18:51]
 are now that's in assembly. We've got these down here to translate them around in our assembly. [0:18:58]
 We're going to take the defaults for our first part. So this is the LCS you added to that clip file [0:19:05]
 that clip model. And this is the LCS that's there by default in the model in the assembly. [0:19:13]
 Let's come up and hit OK. So we look at the model. So this is the model in the assembly. [0:19:20]
 That's the LCS. And now that clip has been added to it. And you can see inside that clip, we've [0:19:28]
 got all the features that have been added to that model. So the part, the pocket and the LCS. [0:19:35]
 If we change anything in the clip, it will get reflected back straight away in the assembly. [0:19:43]
 So for instance, if I save this, then it will be reflected in assembly here. Let me try [0:19:52]
 adding something. So I'm going to click on this top bit. And what we'll do, we'll come over to [0:19:58]
 the part design. And what should we add? That's add. Actually, that's coming in. [0:20:03]
 And just fill it this top off here. So I'll take that and add fillet or chamfer. [0:20:12]
 Let's go fill it. They go a little bit longer and here OK. I haven't saved, come back to this assembly. [0:20:20]
 You can see on the other side it's taken effect straight away. [0:20:24]
 So it takes effect straight away there. Let's come back to the clip. [0:20:29]
 Controls at that. Click the assembly and that's gone. So it's instant straight away that [0:20:38]
 amendment has been added. If we save at this assembly, what'll happen is that everything underneath [0:20:46]
 that that's been used will get saved as well. Just hit yes. You see the clip has been saved as well. [0:20:51]
 Let's come back to the assembly. This one here and come back to the assembly for [0:20:59]
 webage. That's how they're fast enough. So using the fastness dropped out here or assembly, [0:21:05]
 fastness, we can insert a screw and that washer. The screw will be also bolts where we can use bolts [0:21:13]
 in there. So I'm going to hit insert screw and we'll get a screw that's inside. [0:21:18]
 You can see that there. Let's come over to the model tab. [0:21:22]
 You can see it's M6 times 8 screw. Let's be added. [0:21:27]
 And if we click on that we've got all of the few properties. One of the data tab we've got the [0:21:35]
 diameter here. M6. We can drop this down to M5 to match this hole. [0:21:41]
 And if we click off we've got some options here left handed, length for such a hole. [0:21:48]
 I will make this a bit longer. So I'm going to set this to around about 12. Click off that takes effect. [0:21:53]
 And also if we don't want a flat head, we can change the ISO's number here. So I'm not sure [0:22:03]
 what ones these are. Unless pick one. Don't want that. I'm looking for more of a hexagon type bolt. [0:22:09]
 This is easier in the fasteners workbench because you can actually see them all long here. [0:22:18]
 So I want this one which is add DN capnut thin style. If I click on that there's that DN and that [0:22:27]
 tells me a type DIN 917. So it's easier if I are there. [0:22:32]
 Let's go back to the assembly workbench. [0:22:36]
 Assembly 4. Click on that. Actually that's quite a good one to add. I think. [0:22:42]
 I might just add this one. And if I want to drop this down, [0:22:47]
 we should be able to find the DN ones here. There we go. [0:22:50]
 I'm going to stick with this. Now we've added that. Well, how to we align it with this hole. [0:22:58]
 This is where another corner system comes in. And it's called [0:23:04]
 the whole axis. To add that, let's come back to the clip. [0:23:10]
 Because we've got added to this clip. And we're going to add that to one of these holes. [0:23:17]
 So I'm going to take this hole here. So at the top of it, because this is where the bolt will go through. [0:23:23]
 And I'm in the assembly 4. And we can use our create a new corner system. [0:23:29]
 Or can come up to the assembly and create a datum object. And we see the new hole [0:23:35]
 access there. Click that. And we get this line going through that hole. Which is exactly what we [0:23:42]
 want. Come back to the assembly. That will automatically be added there. [0:23:46]
 So it's there. I'm just going to save that from here and come back. [0:23:50]
 Lime of the fastener with this hole is relatively simple. Once you know how, as everything [0:23:58]
 you like, to do that, we select the faster. Then come up to the top and use this icon here. [0:24:06]
 The edit placement of part. If I click that, you'll see this panel here. [0:24:13]
 We've got attached to drop that down. And then click the part is going to be attached to the clip. [0:24:21]
 It will then reveal the look-on systems for that clip. So we've got the LCS origin. [0:24:27]
 And the whole access. Click that. That will move into that hole. [0:24:32]
 Now sometimes this will be upside down or back to front. So we can use these rotate x, y plus 90. [0:24:41]
 And you'll see we can rotate these like so. And sometimes you'll get it like best. And we just [0:24:47]
 rotate it around the other side. And these all rotate in a different manner like c. [0:24:52]
 We've got the translation. So if this was too far out this way, we can bring it down on the Z axis [0:24:58]
 and bring this in and bring this back, etc. So we've got to control over that. That's it. [0:25:06]
 Okay. So that's now aligned with that hole there. Now you may have noticed something with the [0:25:14]
 screw is that we haven't got a thread. So we've got a screw that's easy for solved. We've got a thread [0:25:19]
 to drop this down and set it to true and click off. You'll take a little while to calculate [0:25:25]
 the calculator because any thread does add that extra burden on the CPU. So if you want to, [0:25:32]
 you can do this last of all or even leave it out totally. If you're freely printing it, then [0:25:37]
 you want to add these threads anyway. So I'm just going to set threads to force the time being. [0:25:44]
 I'm a very very slow computer. So the next thing I'm going to do is add the part. I'm going to [0:25:51]
 add the part to this side. And it's basically the same process. So I'm going to import a part. So we can [0:26:00]
 use the import part from here or like we said before, up on the toolbar and assembly, [0:26:06]
 import part, open the file and the rectangle. Bring that rectangle in insert. [0:26:17]
 We were going to else yes on the rectangle. So let's go to the rectangle and we're in the [0:26:24]
 assembly workbench. Let's cancel out there. Let's go past that rectangle again. Now we go [0:26:30]
 and let's pick that whole and add a new whole axis. We do it from the toolbar this time. [0:26:40]
 That's added there. So you can see it there and what we'll do is now come down to the [0:26:54]
 stringed clip and click on the rectangle and using the edit placement of the part. [0:27:02]
 We see that whole axis there. What do we want to touch you to? We want to touch it to the clip. [0:27:08]
 So I'll draw this down, click clip. And we're going to touch it to whole axis that one there. [0:27:15]
 So you can see that's attached. Fire that fastener to there but it's embedded in there and that's [0:27:26]
 where our XYZ transition comes in. So we want to use the Z and move this down. Well this is [0:27:35]
 three millimeter width and we move it down to three milp there it is there. And we'll go to [0:27:42]
 rotation so we can rotate it around the right way and where do we want it? Should have perhaps [0:27:51]
 done the transition after I did the rotation. There we go. So we like that. Let's go for that and [0:27:59]
 hit OK. So now we've got our second part in there. Part designed part fastener. At the moment [0:28:10]
 well we need a nut on here. So that's out of nut. So fastener's again come down. Insert nut. [0:28:18]
 It's match this two at M5 so come over to here. Diota is M5. That's added there. We've got the LCS [0:28:31]
 of this clip. So this LCS runs this way. So we can just add that nut to there. [0:28:38]
 Using the same LCS. So click on the nut and again using the edit placement of the part. [0:28:48]
 Attach to the clip because of the LCS. The whole axis and then we do the Z translation. [0:28:59]
 That's going to go down to six seven all the way down and we're placing in there. We may want [0:29:08]
 to place a washer. There's washers as well which we can place. So that's sitting there. Like so. [0:29:13]
 That's in there. So that's already added. Again this nut has a thread. So if I click on that M5 nut [0:29:22]
 and come down you'll see a thread there which we can choose to be true if we're 3D [0:29:28]
 printing etc. And that's the basic assembly. We've got other features in here such as we can [0:29:35]
 take this and create another one of these in here. So we're not just restricted to one of these. [0:29:43]
 If I insert another one we can use the clip body again and insert. So I've got another one inside here. [0:29:51]
 You can see there's some ghost in around here. That's the other one that's actually inserted. [0:29:55]
 And I can line this up so you can find the whole axis. If I wanted to do or even the LCS origin [0:30:02]
 and attach to the parent assembly and rotate that. That's a click the LCS so I'll get it right. [0:30:11]
 There we go rotate that so you can see how that's rotated or rotate that way and then rotate [0:30:19]
 and we get a different rotation. So I would experiment with these rotations if I was you to actually [0:30:26]
 get these right. So actually get an idea of if we rotate around that way then I'll see [0:30:34]
 S because it's connected to an arc is not centered so we'll get a different type of [0:30:41]
 placement to pin on the rotation. So I would have to adjust this now because we've got this [0:30:46]
 round in here, this rectangle round. So I may want to translate it along the Z. [0:30:51]
 To out here or that's pick part of assembly. Let's line it to the clip and do it fire [0:31:02]
 whole axis. So I've attached it to the whole axis there. Like so and when we rotate that that's [0:31:10]
 gonna rotate around that way. Let's rotate around the Z axis. You can see that's rotating around [0:31:18]
 that whole axis there and we can translate along the Z as translated to where that [0:31:25]
 knuckle B and okay that click the nut and we'll use the edit placement of part and just make [0:31:35]
 some alterations that some minus nine. Bring this down to minus 12 or minus 13, [0:31:42]
 minus 12 and okay and there we have well assembly that we're putting together [0:31:50]
 and at any time we can change the rotation location of these and move them about [0:31:58]
 just by coming in and clicking making sure we got the objects that you see the pocket selected [0:32:07]
 there. Let's click the body must be the body not any of these features within. So click the body [0:32:15]
 and then click the edit placement of part and then we can use our rotations etc. [0:32:23]
 And okay that. So there you go a simple assembly with fasteners and how to use them in free [0:32:36]
 CAD. Remember that when you save it saves all away through here so we just hit yes and [0:32:43]
 that's the demonstration for that done. So I hope you enjoyed that video. We're going to be [0:32:48]
 doing some more of the assembly for what Benchney even look at the other assembly, what Benchney's [0:32:52]
 because there's quite a few out there and they all assemble in different ways and do different [0:32:58]
 things. Some of them have got simulations in there as well. We'll also revisit the assembly for as [0:33:03]
 well to learn about animations and more complex assemblies with supper assemblies etc. I'll [0:33:09]
 we enjoy that video. I hope to see you again soon. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. [0:33:14]
