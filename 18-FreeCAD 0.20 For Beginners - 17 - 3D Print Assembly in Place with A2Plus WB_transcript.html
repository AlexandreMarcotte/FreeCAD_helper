===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 17 - 3D Print Assembly in Place with A2Plus WB =====
 Hi, viewers and welcome to another episode of the Learning Free Cat for Pregnance. [0:00:05]
 Where we're teaching fundamentals of free cat, whilst we learn workflows, and also show [0:00:10]
 practical examples for those workflows. In this tutorial, we're going to be looking at the [0:00:15]
 A2 Plus Workbench and the subject of printing in place. So this is where we print an object that [0:00:23]
 has connections, but print it as one single object. So for instance, in this tutorial, [0:00:29]
 we're going to take this simple link. One letter and a touch it in the A2 Plus Workbench [0:00:35]
 to a number of other links. So they connect together through a whole own shaft. [0:00:40]
 We can then simulate that in the A2 Plus Workbench to see the movement. [0:00:45]
 And then print this on a 3D printer after slicing it and produce some movable part [0:00:55]
 by that rod and hole. This will be the first video that's looking in the A2 Plus Workbench, [0:01:00]
 and then we're going to go deeper into there to understand what about the constraints and the [0:01:06]
 way objects link up in A2 Plus. So I hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a look at this [0:01:11]
 workflow. If you like, we are seeing please subscribe to the site. I also have a co-fire or a [0:01:17]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. Before we get into some [0:01:39]
 modeling, that's installed a workbench that we need. We're going to be installing the A2 Plus [0:01:43]
 from the tools add-on manager. From here, if we start typing A2 Plus, we'll see the workbench here, [0:01:53]
 which we can install if we don't have it installed already. The A2 Plus differs from the [0:01:59]
 assembly workbench such as assembly 4 and that is philosophy is as you see, keep it simple. [0:02:05]
 This makes the workbench very easy to deal with because we don't have to worry about [0:02:09]
 local corner systems or adding any extra data objects to align our profiles. [0:02:14]
 I'm just going to click on the workbench and install it. Once it's installed, we're going to [0:02:22]
 reload free CAD and then we're ready to go. I'm going to start by creating a new document [0:02:30]
 and in this tutorial we're going to be using the part design. We can use the part for one two [0:02:35]
 and what we're going to do is create a simple link object. This object will connect with [0:02:42]
 itself to make a chain of repeating objects that we can use to print in place with the A2 Plus [0:02:50]
 workbench. It's up to you what we create but this is for a demonstration purpose. So I'm going to [0:02:56]
 create a body and then create a sketch. We're going to go along the xy plane and hit OK. So this is [0:03:02]
 going to be a very basic object. I'm looking down on our scene and I'm going to create a slot. [0:03:10]
 So just using the slot tool. I'm going to constrain to the center. You can see I got the order [0:03:14]
 constraints on. Then we can come up and place it connected to this line. I've got some redundant [0:03:20]
 constraints because I've added it to that line and also I had a horizontal constraint there. [0:03:26]
 Which wasn't needed so it's made it redundant. That's add some constraints in here so I'm [0:03:31]
 going to take these two points and make this 25mm. Also going to add a diamond constraint to this [0:03:40]
 arc. So use a diameter and set this to 15mm. Once we've got our shape we can close and astrude this. [0:03:52]
 In part design is known as a pad so make sure the sketch is selected. You can see a sledge over here [0:04:00]
 and we'll pad this. I'm going to pad this by 12mm and also make the pad symmetrical to [0:04:07]
 plane. This means if we turn the grid on you'll see this will be slicing through that plane. You [0:04:13]
 can see we've got the axis cross on and that's available if I OK that from view toggle axis cross. [0:04:20]
 I need to see that's in the middle of that axis cross. This just makes it a bit easier when I take [0:04:27]
 a section to out here to make a slot allowing these to be linked together. Now guys, [0:04:34]
 best practice is I am actually going to fill it this straight away. The reason being is because I [0:04:40]
 want the shape and I know that fill it's not going to affect anything else. I'm going to click [0:04:46]
 on this face and then create the fillet. Now I'm going to set this fillet [0:04:51]
 pressing the upper arrow on the radius. I'm going to set it so it's just on the margin of error. [0:05:01]
 So at the moment 5mm if I go one more you're going to go into error and you can see we've gone [0:05:07]
 back to the wall pad. Let's bring this back down. That's set this to something like 5.99. [0:05:14]
 That's allow that to take and hit OK and you can see that for that as taken all the way around there [0:05:24]
 because filleting this face. Why don't you succeed if all the other faces go it around for fillet. [0:05:34]
 So we've got this lottinger type shape here. If you wanted to we could do this with something like [0:05:41]
 a primitive object like a lip-soyed or an oval but I just can use fillets for the time being [0:05:48]
 because it's easier and we haven't touched on primitive objects in our course as of yet. [0:05:54]
 That's create a sketch. Now this sketch is going to section through here and we'll pocket this [0:06:01]
 to make space. Let's click on the top and make sure nothing's selected and create a new sketch. [0:06:08]
 Then go along the x-y-plane. If I add smangled to this you'll see that the plane here the x-y-plane [0:06:21]
 sections through the center of here. That's here OK. We're now through the center of the object. [0:06:30]
 Using the section view or can't sketch view section we'll cut this object in half. [0:06:38]
 Use an navigation cube to make sure that we're around the right way because if we start [0:06:46]
 bringing this around sometimes it becomes hard if we can't say we're like this it actually looks [0:06:51]
 like the same as if this we get this illusion. So always use your navigation cube to align yourself [0:06:58]
 in a free space. Now we've got this shape and that's create a circle in here and pocket it. [0:07:05]
 Then we can create another approach on this side that will slot into this section when we repeat [0:07:13]
 a number of links in our assembly. Using the circle make sure we alter constrain to that center [0:07:21]
 point here. We've got the order constraints on. We've got coincident constraint and we'll come out [0:07:26]
 just beyond. I'm going to hit escape and click on this circle and add some dimensions. [0:07:37]
 So we're going to insert a diameter and set this to 16 millimeters and hit OK. [0:07:42]
 This allows us some gaping in here to allow for the connection to move freely in this space. [0:07:51]
 As it close you can see the sketch is moving there. Now we can use the pocket. [0:07:59]
 This will create a pocket moving downwards. That's made sure that's a symmetrical to plain [0:08:07]
 as selected and we can see that pocket in there. And you can see the curve to we have. [0:08:13]
 The length is 5 millimeters. We can go for that. We can adjust that later and hit OK. [0:08:22]
 Now we've got one side done. Let's do the other side. We're going to repeat this on the other side but [0:08:28]
 this time we're going to take material off this part and this part. So we get a female and male side. [0:08:36]
 Let's try that. Let's click on top. Make sure nothing gets slanted. Create the sketch. [0:08:45]
 This time we're going to go along the XY plane again and hit OK. We are now positioned along the [0:08:52]
 XY plane and we can create another sketch. Use the section view. I'm going to import some geometry [0:09:00]
 because we've got nothing to attach the circle too. So I need to take this geometry [0:09:08]
 imported so I'll get a centre point. To do that I'm going to use this tool here, external geometry. [0:09:13]
 Also available for sketch, sketch geometries, external geometry. If I highlight this edge here [0:09:23]
 you can see I can import it. Click on the edge we get the centre point. I can now use my circle [0:09:30]
 and create a circle against that centre point and bring this out. Again we're going to set this [0:09:38]
 to 16mm. Click on circle, add a diameter and set this to 16. Hit enter. That's it close. We now [0:09:49]
 have that sketch in there. I'm going to take that sketch and come out to edit and duplicate selection. [0:09:58]
 I'm going to uncheck the pocket just leaving the sketch there. I'm going to uncheck the [0:10:04]
 plane as well. We don't need that. And here OK. We now got two sketches that are the same. [0:10:11]
 I'm going to move one sketch up and one sketch down. Click on the first sketch we created and move [0:10:19]
 this up. This will be a long attachment and the position. We're open up the position and we're [0:10:26]
 going to move it long the z axis and we can move that up. Now the idea is to move it so [0:10:34]
 it's around about a millimeter away from the top here to allow for the printing place process [0:10:42]
 because we don't want those adhering to that surface. You can play with dimensions, pin on size of [0:10:51]
 the extrusion nozzle that you're using the 3D printer or to personal preferences. So that's [0:10:56]
 two millimeters coming to the F1. Looking on the z axis again and we use a minus two millimeters [0:11:03]
 there. So we've got those two. We're now going to pocket these. Take our first sketch and we use a pocket. [0:11:12]
 Now this may go in the wrong direction as you see here. Just click on reverse and we can set this to [0:11:20]
 through all that will go all the way through here or two first. Okay, let's add first pocket done. [0:11:30]
 Let's do the same with this one. So this sketch is pocket this, using the pocket. This is going [0:11:38]
 the right way so we can go through all or two first, e-roll, it doesn't matter. Let's hit okay. [0:11:49]
 And now we've got the starts of our model. I'm going to place a hole in this side. [0:11:58]
 Now before we add the holes, let's get a quick overview of how this is going to join together. [0:12:05]
 To do that, we're just going to mock up the assembly. So that's coming into something like [0:12:12]
 the draw for a bench and we're going to make a clone. You can see the grid in it on, [0:12:17]
 and you can see how that's intercepting that plane there. Just going to make a simple clone of this, [0:12:23]
 click on on the body and using the clone. We could have done this in the part design. [0:12:27]
 It doesn't matter, but one other thing we can do with draw for clicking on the body, we can [0:12:32]
 click on the last action and clone that. So come up to modifications and clone this creates a [0:12:39]
 simple clone off that pocket. You can see a clone there, which I can right click and transform. [0:12:45]
 And I can move this over and get an idea of how this is going to look. [0:12:50]
 So we can see how that fits in there. As hit okay and I have some transparency to the clone, [0:13:01]
 but click on that clone pocket coming down to the view, moving down to the transparency [0:13:08]
 and breaking the transparency up for something like A-T. This allows us to see inside. [0:13:13]
 So you can see how that's inside there. You can see we've got clearance and if I transform [0:13:22]
 that bit more right click, transform, we can get an idea of where this has to be to allow for the [0:13:32]
 hole. So we can see that sitting in there. And we just get an idea of what is going to look [0:13:44]
 like and how they're going to connect together. Let's now create the hole. I'm going to keep [0:13:51]
 the clone and hit okay and before I exit the draw for a bench, I'm just going to turn the grid [0:13:57]
 enough, but it's tall down here. Let's go back to the part design. [0:14:02]
 Now we're back in the part design and I can hide this clone and come in and create the sketch [0:14:17]
 upon here. Let's click on this face and create a new sketch. We've attached the sketch to here. [0:14:25]
 Now we've got a pull is in geometry because I want the center point. So that's try pulling [0:14:32]
 in geometry from here. You can see we've pulled in a beast line. This is no good to us because it [0:14:40]
 doesn't have the center point. To remove that, let's come over to the tasks and scroll down [0:14:48]
 to find that beast line under the elements. You can see we've got purple dots. This means [0:14:55]
 it's an external reference. And we can see that by dropping down. We drop down here to external [0:15:04]
 and that doesn't change. So construction, external or all you can see this one is external. [0:15:12]
 Let's come over, hit a scape to get the mouse point back or hit the right mouse button [0:15:20]
 and highlight that edge and hit the delete key. Let's remove that now. Now we'll [0:15:28]
 always find that center in there from the geometry we've already placed in. It's a use the original [0:15:33]
 sketch. Let's come over to the model and find that last action which is this pocket here [0:15:41]
 and coming and find this sketch and press the space bar. We can see we've got one of the [0:15:50]
 circles that's built this feature and we can use the impulse geometry against that circle. Let's do that [0:15:58]
 and bring that in. We've bought in that circle. We could also use this circle here. [0:16:06]
 Let's pull that in there as well. So we've got a choice. I've got this edge or one of the circle [0:16:17]
 sketches. We don't need both. So I'm going to go over for this edge here as hit delete on that circle. [0:16:26]
 So just showing you the options that we have. If you can't find standard geometry and you [0:16:32]
 keep them getting bee splines. The bee splines are because we've removed a pocket from here and we're [0:16:38]
 no longer left. We've extended an arc geometry. That describes that pocket. This is especially common [0:16:45]
 when you have curved features like this. We've fill it at this and we have this curvature. [0:16:51]
 Because if we come around this way we can see when we pocket we have different whips of pocket in [0:16:58]
 that run down here. So this will be described as a bee spline if we pull it in the geometry. [0:17:05]
 I'm just going to hide this sketch here. Click on that sketch and press this base bar and we're [0:17:10]
 going to start adding the hole. Using the create a circle. I'm going to add a hole in here. [0:17:19]
 Now I'm going to create this quite big to allow for this link to remove freely in here. [0:17:25]
 I'm going to hit a scape. Click on this circle and add some diameter. I'm going to set this one to [0:17:32]
 six millimeters. Come over to the toss and we'll come over. Scroll up and hit close. [0:17:40]
 We've got our sketch in here. We can now click on that sketch and use the pocket. [0:17:48]
 I'm going to go to first and hit OK. We've got our hole. Now let's create [0:18:00]
 in here a shaft that works. Go through this hole to connect up. I'm going to click on this face [0:18:07]
 inside and create a sketch. That's used as such a view. Now we're going to add the shaft that [0:18:15]
 goes through the hole. We're going to use a circle and alt constraint to this center point. [0:18:22]
 Come out and create a circle. Now if we look at this without the section of view, [0:18:32]
 we can see what's going to happen. When the shaft goes in here and we'll create this assembly, [0:18:39]
 they should all link together. When I pad this, we'll be able to see this in the actual draft as [0:18:48]
 well so that draft clone. We'll be able to see that in there. That's how it's in dimensions. [0:18:52]
 So we've got this circle here. Let's hit a scape or hit the right mouse button. [0:18:56]
 Get the mouse point of back. Click on the circle add a diameter. This diameter is six. [0:19:05]
 So we can go for something like four and hit OK. Let's come out and hit close. [0:19:12]
 We've got this circle here. We've got the sketch selected. We need pad and we need to come up [0:19:21]
 to the first face at the moment it's gone all the way through. So you use the type, [0:19:27]
 bring this down and click on two first. That means this is padded up to that first face there. [0:19:35]
 We hit OK. We've got our finished link. Now that's how we look to see what's happened with the clone. [0:19:44]
 So we come down and we can see our clone is still here. For press this space bar to make it visible. [0:19:51]
 We can see what's starting to happen now. Let's click off. [0:19:55]
 So we've got our clone which was just the clone of that pocket. Now if we clone the body, [0:20:07]
 it will take in the clone of all of this body. So we can use the clone at different stages. [0:20:15]
 All who just clone the body is a hole. That's see if we can change that clone. [0:20:20]
 Let's come down and have a look at that cloned pocket and use the data. [0:20:27]
 Come down. We can see the draft and the objects. We've got pocket zero zero two. We can change this. [0:20:34]
 We're clicking on that field. Click on the button. Heading clear. [0:20:41]
 And then we can slat whatever we want from the list. I could slat the body. [0:20:48]
 Or could slat last action. Did not buy the little green arrow as the tip. [0:20:54]
 So we can slat that pad from here. Or let the pad from the list and here. Okay. [0:21:01]
 If I click off everything recomputes and you can see [0:21:07]
 that our hole has now got the rod going through it there. [0:21:13]
 And everything looks okay. We can now use this in the assembly. [0:21:20]
 I'm going to get rid of this pocket, this cloned pocket and hit the lead. So don't need that now. [0:21:27]
 I'm going to hit file and save us and create a new folder. [0:21:35]
 And in here I'm going to name this just as A2 plus demo. [0:21:40]
 I'm going to save everything into this folder. [0:21:44]
 Let's open up the folder and save this. Say as I'm going to cut like a link. [0:21:51]
 Hit save. That's our first model created. So we're going to use repeat of this model in our assembly. [0:21:59]
 So that's start with the assembly. So now we're going to create the assembly. [0:22:04]
 I'm going to close that link and start a new document. [0:22:10]
 And it's very well going to save it. So file. Say that's [0:22:14]
 and we're inside that A2 plus demo. And just call this I'll be like A2 plus a symbol. [0:22:22]
 So now we've got our document ready to go. That's come over to the A2 plus workbench. [0:22:30]
 So the A2 plus workbench is actually quite easy to use. It's much more simpler approach and it [0:22:38]
 requires less setting up. So we look along the top here. We have a number of constraints. [0:22:43]
 And these allow you to take, say, a niche, a face, etc. And connect those together. [0:22:50]
 So we can import one model and connect parts of that model to another model or something that [0:22:57]
 we created in another workbench within the same assembly. That's first import our link. [0:23:04]
 We can use the tool I shaped from a stone file found on the toolbar or can come up to the A2 plus [0:23:11]
 menu and come down to add a part from a stone file. Click on that and choose our link [0:23:19]
 file that we just created. Double click it and we've got our first model in our assembly. [0:23:27]
 I've got nothing to attach this to. We've clicked on that link to RZO1 and come down. You can see that [0:23:36]
 the first item that's imported has a fixed position of true. Now this is important when we come [0:23:44]
 to such things as simulations. There's a very basic simulation system in here and we're going to [0:23:50]
 be sharing that off in a moment. That's import another link. Make sure nothing's selected. [0:23:56]
 Cut to A2 plus and choose an apart from a stone file or use the toolbar and we're click on that [0:24:09]
 link file again. It's going to ask what to import. We've got multiple bodies in here. We can [0:24:16]
 access that multiple bodies. We've only got one to select that and import it. Now as we move the mouse [0:24:25]
 the new model will come available and we can drop it where everyone. That's just drop it into [0:24:34]
 the spare space over here. Quite close to this link. We can move this by using the move of selected [0:24:45]
 part tool or we can just right click and transform and move that somewhere. Here we go. [0:24:53]
 We're clicking on that and using the move of selected part then we get the same transform option there. [0:25:02]
 Here we go. I'm going to now attach this part to this one so we're going to change them together. [0:25:10]
 We want to use this shaft and this hole. Now the two things in common with this are the [0:25:20]
 circle edges. So we take the circular edge from one here by slatting that edge. [0:25:29]
 Come over to the other one hold down control and slat the corresponding edge. Now if I slat this one [0:25:38]
 it will be lined up. So if I look to see where this one should fall it should be really this [0:25:45]
 top edge here so this circle here is top circle. Hold down control click that one. [0:25:50]
 We've got the two circles slatted. If we come up here we can see all the constraints are now available. [0:26:00]
 I'm going to use the add circular edge constraint because we've added two circle edges. [0:26:06]
 Click on that. They will be joined together like so. You can see that we've got [0:26:15]
 that edge but in up right close to the top here. Now if you come over to the left we've got some [0:26:23]
 offset here so we can lower that down and if we use the up and down arrows it's in millimeters. [0:26:31]
 So I'm going to actually type in 0.5 and we use minus 0.5. That places it in the center there [0:26:42]
 and we've got clearance from both sides. If this is around the wrong way we can use the flip [0:26:53]
 direction here as well. So we can flip it around. I'm happy with where that's positioned [0:27:04]
 and I hit a set. Now it's positioned if I click on this one look at this little body [0:27:16]
 we can see the fixed position is false. So we've connected this to a fixed object this one [0:27:23]
 and this one is false. This allows for simulation. So I'm trying to move this now it won't move. [0:27:31]
 So I click on the move for static part under constraints and try to move this it's not going to [0:27:38]
 move we need another one in our chain. So that's add another one. Come up to the A2 plus [0:27:46]
 add a part from a standard file and then click the link again and hit open. [0:27:52]
 Move the mouse, add link appears and we'll get go for the same process. Click to drop, [0:28:00]
 come in and we'll select the circle, age there and the circle that is going to connect to. [0:28:11]
 So this one here, control select. Now click on the circle constraint and we need some offset [0:28:19]
 so we can see that's gone in there and I set the offset to minus 0.5. [0:28:25]
 So we added that link in there. Set that now when we move this link by using this tool here [0:28:38]
 the soft selected part under constraint. Click and you can see we have some movement in our model. [0:28:46]
 So we can see how this is going to move when we actually print it. So when it's all connected together [0:28:54]
 and you can see that we can actually go into the body so there is no physics involved in this. [0:29:00]
 This is just solving the connection. So you couldn't use this for something like gear T for anything [0:29:07]
 like that. It's just a basic solver but guess you an idea of how this will move under constraint. [0:29:13]
 That's just clicked drop this and we're back to where we started. [0:29:20]
 Make sure we save. One goes to do now. It's export out this whole assembly. To do that [0:29:28]
 I'm going to control click all the links in here and use the file [0:29:34]
 export and I can export it out as an STL file and object file etc. I step file if I wanted to. [0:29:42]
 I'm just going to go for the standard STL file and save this off. [0:29:47]
 So what I've actually saved we come to file, import and pick the STL file. [0:29:56]
 Hide the links by highlights and more pressing the spacebar. We can see we've got [0:30:04]
 our model in there and that is ready to print. All going to do is just delete this before [0:30:14]
 I print it and just show you some other things in here so I'm going to press the spacebar on [0:30:18]
 these to bring the back. If we come into our tree, open these up. You'll see the constraints within. [0:30:26]
 So we've got all these constraints here and it also shows where they link to. [0:30:35]
 So if I click one, card safety plus, a few and highlight both constraint parts. Click on that. [0:30:44]
 We can see where those two are constrained so you can see the link body there and the link [0:30:50]
 0.1 here. It shows how those are constrained and where they're constrained so we can see that green [0:30:57]
 circles in there showing where we added the constraint. This is really handy to figure out [0:31:07]
 if we get start what parts are constrained to where. These other constraints I will go into in [0:31:13]
 another tutorial so this is just a basic tutorial of how to constrain these simple parts together [0:31:19]
 and how to do a 3D print in place. Asslice and print an air steal and see the results. [0:31:24]
 So I hope you enjoyed that video. Hope this 3D print is actually bringing you a new dimension [0:31:30]
 to the channel and you're seeing this physical output and what you can actually do with 3CAD to make [0:31:36]
 these physical forms. I'll be doing more in the A2 plus workbench in future videos so we can learn [0:31:43]
 more about these constraints that live on this toolbar here. Hope to see you again soon and I hope [0:31:49]
 to see you in the next video. If you like we have seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a [0:31:54]
