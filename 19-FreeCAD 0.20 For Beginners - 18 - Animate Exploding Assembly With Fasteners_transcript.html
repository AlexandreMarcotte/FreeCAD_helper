===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 18 - Animate Exploding Assembly With Fasteners =====
 I have one at welcome back to another episode of the Learning Freak Have For Beginners, where we're [0:00:04]
 teaching the fundamentals of free-canned, with practical examples, and whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:10]
 Today we're going to be looking at exploding and assemblies. [0:00:12]
 So before we've looked at the assembly work benches, both 80 plus and assembly 4, we've [0:00:19]
 touched on those. [0:00:20]
 We're now going to touch on the exploding of assemblies. [0:00:23]
 So this takes place after assembly has been made and it allows us to animate the assemblies. [0:00:29]
 So we have an assembly here and this is the one we're going to actually create. [0:00:34]
 When you hit play, you can see how that assemblies to blows out and comes back together. [0:00:40]
 We're going to learn how to create this in the A2 plus workbench. [0:00:44]
 How to constrain this and then use the exploded assembly workbench to create this animation. [0:00:51]
 So I hope you enjoy this series and let's have a look at this workbench. [0:00:56]

 So in the last couple of tutorials we'll be using the assembly workbench in this tutorial [0:01:25]
 we're going to be using the A2 plus workbench, the Fastness workbench and also something [0:01:30]
 called this explode assembly and they can all be installed from the tools add-on manager. [0:01:38]
 Here you've got the A2 plus workbench and for you to filter we have the Fastness workbench [0:01:45]
 and this is just to place some Fastness that we can use as a bolt and nuts to connect [0:01:49]
 the assembly together and last of all we're going to be using the explode assembly workbench. [0:01:57]
 This one I'm going to install now. [0:02:00]
 This allows you to do an explosion of your assembly so it's animated on screen as long [0:02:06]
 as you got in the assembly there. [0:02:08]
 It's not an actual assembly workbench, it's just more for the movement so we'll install [0:02:13]
 that. [0:02:14]
 And we'll be close, you may have to restart free CAD if you haven't already going installed. [0:02:21]
 Now we have the necessary workbench installed, that's start to create our document. [0:02:25]
 So I'm going to create new scene and I can come up to view and the toggle access cross. [0:02:31]
 That's already in there, I'm just going to turn that off because I don't need that for the time being. [0:02:36]
 I'm going to create some parts to assemble together so it's in simple parts. [0:02:41]
 We can use the part design or the part workbench even the draft, it's that's you only want to use. [0:02:46]
 For this one I'm just going to create a body and create a sketch along the x-wine plane and hit OK. [0:02:55]
 Once we've done that I'm going to create a simple tube with a flange. [0:02:58]
 It's the first off I'm going to create a circle. [0:03:02]
 I'm going to give this some dimensions so this is going to be quite quick to actually model. [0:03:07]
 I'm going to go 80mm, OK on that one. [0:03:10]
 Let's close. [0:03:12]
 We'll give this some padding so make sure that the sketch is selected and pad this and we're just going to give it [0:03:19]
 a round of 3mm pad just bring it up off the surface. [0:03:23]
 I'm going to create a sketch on top of this. [0:03:26]
 Use a sketch and we'll create a tube so all two constraints of the center, I've got the [0:03:34]
 order constraints on and we're going to come out to around about here, here's scope and sets [0:03:41]
 in diameter and we're going to set this to 50mm. [0:03:44]
 That's close again and take that circle and pad that. [0:03:52]
 I'm going to pad that to around about 40mm. [0:03:54]
 I'm going to take this top face, create a sketch and we're going to pocket this circle to [0:04:02]
 great the inside so place a pocket in there. [0:04:05]
 Just to circle this I've wasted doing this but I'm just going to sketch a circle, [0:04:10]
 click on that place in diameter and we'll set that one to 45mm. [0:04:16]
 I'm going to take that sketch, I'm going to click on it and use the pocket. [0:04:23]
 We're going to go through all the other side. [0:04:30]
 See, okay now I'm going to sketch some holes that go around here so taking that top face [0:04:38]
 and create a sketch and we'll use a circle once again, this is all made with circles. [0:04:44]
 Come in and place a circle in here. [0:04:48]
 I set the diameter of this circle and say 9mm. [0:04:54]
 I'm just going to come in and bring in some geometry so I'm going to bring in this edge here. [0:05:01]
 I'm going to zoom in and take this edge and the top edge. [0:05:07]
 I'm going to hit escape and I'm going to place a point. [0:05:13]
 I'm going to use the point and come in and zoom in. I'm going to place a point on this line. [0:05:20]
 I add one to that line. I'm going to take that point and that important edge [0:05:25]
 and place some point on object constraint. So I've constrained it there. [0:05:30]
 The reason why I'm doing this is to center this across these two circles. [0:05:35]
 I add another point and we'll place it on that line so you can see that I've got the point on object [0:05:41]
 constraint coming up. So place that on there. [0:05:44]
 That's gone onto that vertical line, that vertical axis, so take this point and this circle [0:05:51]
 and use a point on object constraint. [0:05:54]
 Let me so I can take both these points, this point and this point and this point in the middle [0:06:04]
 and make those symmetrical to each other. Go run another constraint, let's click on that and hit [0:06:11]
 delete. So we've got that centered now. Let's hit close and I'm going to pop it that, [0:06:18]
 using the pocket and that's gone down length of five millimeters. That's go through all [0:06:25]
 and hit OK. So we've got one hole in there. We're going to array these around here by using [0:06:34]
 a pull the button. So click on that pocket and we need to come up to part design, [0:06:40]
 play a button and come down to pull the button and you can see how they've transformed. So we've [0:06:49]
 got a circle over here and pull it over here because we've applied it to that feature and we can just [0:06:56]
 apply a number of feeds so we can do a current or say six. [0:07:00]
 That place is all those around there. Let's come up and here OK. So we've got our part that I want [0:07:10]
 to use. We're good to add some for this into this but I'm just going to leave it as is. Let's save this [0:07:14]
 and I'm just going to place this on my desktop and in here I'm going to call this type assembly [0:07:24]
 and call this pipe. So we've created our first body. I'm going to create a flange that sits [0:07:37]
 in between these so simple gasket or flange that sits here. So I'm going to click on this feature here [0:07:45]
 and what I think I'm going to do is create this in a separate body so we're using multiple [0:07:51]
 bodies. We can create this in a separate file who won't. Let's create a new body. [0:07:56]
 This body is active so we're going to use the sub shape binders. The reason I'm using the [0:08:06]
 sub shape binder is because if I try to create a sketch in here that reference this it won't [0:08:12]
 actually take. So I want to pull in some of this geometry to make it a lot easier. So let's do that. [0:08:17]
 Let's click on that body. Make sure it's active. You can see it's in bold if it's not. We double click [0:08:21]
 here or right click to go to active body. As long as it's in bold it's the active body so any new [0:08:26]
 sketch is get placed within that body and we're looking along the x-wine plane. So you can see that's in [0:08:35]
 there. I'll be along the x-wine plane and hit OK. That's places along the x-wine plane but if I come [0:08:43]
 around this side and try to import this geometry it can see it's flashing and if you look at [0:08:48]
 the left hand side it says the object belongs to another body. You can't link. So you can't link [0:08:53]
 across bodies unless you're using that shape binder. So if close out the sketch I'm going to [0:08:58]
 select that face and click on the sub shape binder or part design create a sub shape by shape binder. [0:09:06]
 We look down, we've got our binder now. So I can come up and hide the original body now so click on this [0:09:14]
 body and press the space bar and clap sounds well so you can see we've got the outline of that there. [0:09:19]
 This can actually be padded so we could use this itself as an object and use that to pad [0:09:28]
 against by don't want to because I want to make this gasket a bit bigger. So now I can come into this [0:09:34]
 sketch, don't click it and I can import the geometry. So click on the import geometry tool [0:09:41]
 next to the geometry and I'm going to pull in this internal circle and also I'm going to bring in [0:09:51]
 one of these circles and this outer circle so if you import it all those now I'm going to use [0:10:00]
 a create circle and create the internal circle now I'm going to come out and just lay it [0:10:06]
 on the side I'm not going to touch it I know that's going to come tangent to there. That can create [0:10:10]
 a silver issue. If I touch that and click off you can see silver felt to converge to get just [0:10:18]
 going to control that. If we get that what we can do is take that circle and this external circle [0:10:27]
 and use the equality and that makes the meacle and that's the process I'm going to go for [0:10:33]
 with this circle as well. So taking this point coming out just not touching the outer circle [0:10:39]
 and then using the equality constraint. This one and this one and making those equal. [0:10:45]
 Next one the outer circle now I want this some distance away from here so I'm going to take the [0:10:53]
 circle again from this point out what's now I've bought in this external geometry. I can use that [0:11:00]
 to reference against I drop in a point on there and saying I want this like two or three millimeters [0:11:06]
 away that's used the point so the points always construction geometry. I'm going to come in I've [0:11:12]
 got the old constraints on and drop it onto this line you can see I've got a point on line constraint [0:11:17]
 appeared so we'll drop it onto that line that's attached to that line now. Good thing about [0:11:23]
 point on line constraint it moves so we can also attach that to our external geometry [0:11:30]
 going to the external geometry and point on line constraint. Now we have a way of saying how far [0:11:39]
 this circle is away from this point but we need to take this point and attach it to another point [0:11:46]
 because I can't attach it to this circle. I'll try that you can see we need two points. So just do the [0:11:53]
 same add another point drop it on to say this circle and point the line constraint then take this [0:12:01]
 point after it's going to get the mouse point up back and take the vertical line. [0:12:06]
 Point the line constraint now we can add some dimensions of a length and I'll say that's two millimeters [0:12:16]
 so we've added that circle in there. I'm just going to bring in some of the other circles as well [0:12:23]
 so I'm going to use this stonald geometry tool to bring in some of these circles [0:12:29]
 and what I'll do is actually bring in all of the eats but I'm just going to bring in three just for [0:12:36]
 this demonstration and add the circles and what we can do go away with is actually taking both these [0:12:46]
 circles and this outer circle and just making those equal because they're the same size. [0:12:51]
 So close we can hide this binder for some space bar and now we can pad this sketch by clicking on [0:13:02]
 this pad and we'll pad this by say two millimeters so we've got that in there so we've got the body [0:13:14]
 if we look at this it's actually sitting inside that but that's absolutely fine so we've got two [0:13:19]
 bodies in here that's rename the first body to pipe and this one to gasket [0:13:35]
 and now we've got something to assemble with that's come over to the A2 plus workbench [0:13:44]
 that's make sure we save this I'm all going to do is start a new document for the assembly [0:13:51]
 we need to save the assembly so far say that's A2 plus wall tell you to save this if you haven't [0:14:00]
 if you start importing your external files into the workbench it's going to call this symbol [0:14:06]
 and here enter now that's import those parts come up to A2 plus and add a part from a external file [0:14:14]
 but we've got the pipe that's coming now you notice that the whole lot is coming [0:14:21]
 this is not what we wanted we want to slap those separate bodies so they've come in as one [0:14:27]
 which is not what we want so as to leave that and this is the difference between [0:14:33]
 add a part from a external file and add shapes from a external file [0:14:37]
 stop click the pipe now it's going to ask you what objects to import so I'll [0:14:44]
 import the both the gasket and the pipe and import so you'll place one down and the other one [0:14:52]
 will be mobile I haven't actually clicked anything so I can place this over here somewhere [0:14:58]
 so we've got both shapes in here as click make sure they're dropped and they are sitting now [0:15:06]
 seen now it's a symbol I'm going to come in and select the inner circles just like this circle [0:15:14]
 and the one that we want to connect to so this circle here across that those [0:15:21]
 we've got the add circular edge constraint or we could use the add axis constraint there [0:15:30]
 because they both built around the center point I'm going to use the circular edge constraint [0:15:36]
 and set that so that's in there the holes line up and we're ready to go [0:15:44]
 they can see the other holes have not been lined up and this is the good thing about A2 plus [0:15:51]
 workbench is that I'm going to save that and come back to that file so file recent files [0:15:59]
 and the pipe and I'm just going to come into this gasket coming to the pad and I'll click the sketch [0:16:07]
 and that's hide this pipe body I'll click another person in spacebar coming to the binder [0:16:14]
 and that's important the geometry so I'm going to import those circles back in like so [0:16:21]
 I'm going to add circles and we're just going to finish this off [0:16:28]
 and select all those circles we've added [0:16:36]
 and select one of the circles [0:16:40]
 easily quality counter tasks it close [0:16:46]
 now got the gasket that's control I start to save it [0:16:50]
 come back to this assembly it hasn't taken effect what we can do if we come up to A2 plus [0:16:57]
 update parts imported into assembly it will update those but you can see we've got a problem [0:17:05]
 and it's asking this that we've got broken strength it's probably because of [0:17:10]
 topological naming issues that's hit yes so the pipe has gone [0:17:16]
 break now the reason why it's gone red is we come back to the pipe again it's invisible [0:17:21]
 so click on that pipe press the spacebar save a game come back to the assembly [0:17:27]
 A2 plus I'll take parts imported into assembly [0:17:32]
 the pipe's back so if you've to watch out for that if you've got something that's hidden it will [0:17:39]
 be hidden in your assembly as well I just can click on that gasket right click and transform [0:17:46]
 and move this out the way and reapply back and strained so we're going to take [0:17:52]
 the circle internal circle here and control click this top one so the circle for circle and [0:18:01]
 here is the circle constraint and a set up so that's in now that's imported some more [0:18:07]
 so we're building this assembly I'm going to use a tool by this time import a standard geometry [0:18:12]
 we want the pipe and open that up this time bringing in the pipe import that [0:18:19]
 sitting on the mouse pointer so I can move it I haven't clicked anywhere so yeah [0:18:25]
 now whatever if I's here if we try to add the circle constraints here and here [0:18:33]
 control click one and control click the other they would be added as they are so the [0:18:41]
 orientation will be wrong so I click that you can see that's been just been inserted inside that [0:18:46]
 so we need to flip the direction to the other side and to set that or we just need to rotate it [0:18:54]
 right click transform and rotate around so we've got those there we've got some alignment issues [0:19:01]
 so that's fixed that and one way of doing that is that we can actually align [0:19:06]
 enough of circle within here so one going to do is click on the pipe [0:19:14]
 and move that pipe right click transform and move this template out what to start so [0:19:22]
 so I can get inside this that's here okay as long as I don't hit the solve I'm okay I can work with this [0:19:32]
 now let's take one of these circles let's take this circle in here and this circle in here [0:19:40]
 control click both of those and use the circle constraint and a set that they are now aligned [0:19:47]
 so we've got two alignments against those also come out there with solver if I transform that [0:19:55]
 I should use the move tool move just let it pop same as right click transform move this out and here [0:20:00]
 okay if I click the ruby cube that'll snap back into place so it's solved up there [0:20:06]
 so now we've got these we need to add some fasteners so let's come over to the fasteners [0:20:15]
 workbench so I'm going to add a bolt a washer and a nut and they all set to M6 at the moment we can change [0:20:28]
 that now let's come over to the A2 plus workbench you notice it's only added one washer [0:20:35]
 we've got comfort all those to an A2 plus part so they can be used within our assembly [0:20:42]
 it's best not to move them at this point just add them in them because you notice that the [0:20:48]
 access cross is in the centre if you can't see the access cross just come up to few [0:20:53]
 and tell the access cross this is where the transform handle will be added as well when we convert [0:20:59]
 these to an A2 plus part if I moved one of these over say out the way over here then the handle [0:21:06]
 will be still attached to this point I'll be forever right click transform and moving back to the [0:21:12]
 handler and pull in the object from back here into position we don't want that we just want it in [0:21:18]
 this point so these have got all the length with if you can see the thread the types of [0:21:25]
 we can change the type if we don't want the ISO version and we can just change whatever type [0:21:30]
 we want here and these all flat heads Phillips etc I'm going to convert these to an A2 plus part [0:21:38]
 now we can do them individually or we can highlight more and come up to A2 plus [0:21:42]
 convert apart to A2 plus part or use luaicum here but you've been converted [0:21:50]
 the originals have been made invisible and compresses based on to get those back [0:21:56]
 now if I transform these out the way I click transform which is moved these out the way [0:22:04]
 so [0:22:07]
 you'll notice that when I click on these we get the A2 plus properties here so if we want to change [0:22:23]
 the size we come back to the hidden version and change say the length or the diameter has changed [0:22:30]
 both we use an M8 and the length we need to change to say 20 you notice nothing's changed [0:22:41]
 I've got to use the refresh or update part important in the assembly or kind of A2 [0:22:46]
 I can come down to the update and that updates the size there I still the rest [0:22:52]
 so using part of their invisible we can highlight those both and do them as one so M8 [0:23:02]
 and that's about it click off use tool while this time refresh and most of the [0:23:09]
 so now we can add these to our assembly I need two washes so if we look the first thing I'm [0:23:22]
 going to do is duplicate this washer so take this washer and it duplicate selection we don't get [0:23:29]
 a jubcation of the original because the original here will control this one as well so any changes [0:23:36]
 will be changed across the mall so that's take this washer and take the center circle [0:23:44]
 and constrain it to one of these circles so this circle here and use the circle constraint [0:23:52]
 so that and we can do the same on the other side so take this one and this one [0:24:00]
 control click those constrain set we may need to make some adjustment to our model because [0:24:10]
 I've embedded in there or I need to shrink down the washer as well so we can do that by coming into [0:24:17]
 that washer I single washer and come in and change it to say a m6 click off and hit the refresh [0:24:29]
 you see that's changed in there it's a bit smaller it's not going to be any good so we can change [0:24:38]
 the m6 back to an m8 so he must remember to click off and then refresh or click on another [0:24:46]
 field so we've got two washes in there that's add the bolt so I'm going to come in and select the [0:24:54]
 inner circle of that bolt so myself positioned take one of these circles this one here and [0:25:03]
 this circle here, try to click those so that and finally do not so taken the circle and the circle here [0:25:16]
 I missed that circle as try again so this circle and the top circle just want to hear [0:25:23]
 it's going to take the inner circle but we've got a bit of origin there so that's going to [0:25:28]
 actually place it in there and we'll also run out of battery turn that off and that's [0:25:34]
 that one in there so in and a set that so we've got the starts of our assembly we have the [0:25:43]
 so what I'm going to do is add another one of these over this side and what we'll do is just [0:25:48]
 repeat this all the way around but we can spend the time as you're playing this load after [0:25:53]
 I've just done one more so I'm going to copy these so the number of ways are doing that we can [0:25:58]
 highlight more go edit jupy selection but what we'll find is that we've got none of the constraints [0:26:07]
 in here so we have to reconstruct or if I highlight those just delete them we can do these one by one [0:26:16]
 so I'm selecting one and use the create jupy cut of a part and what happens when I click that [0:26:22]
 I'll move it onto the mouse pointer and I can drop it somewhere so that might be the [0:26:28]
 fable way of doing it because we can do that and then start constrain in straight away so I can take [0:26:34]
 this one jupy cut and you can see it's here I'm clicking anything just click and then I can actually [0:26:42]
 come in and start constrain in straight away to one of these holes just take this one [0:26:47]
 I'm just trying to set and then do the same with this one [0:26:54]
 I'm just trying to set and then take the button [0:27:02]
 place it near using a circle and constrain it to that circle here I remember that [0:27:17]
 because we're doing this and we're taking this part we still got the original free here that we can [0:27:24]
 control or them by so that's good the last one we want is the nut [0:27:29]
 should we okay and then take the art circle [0:27:36]
 I don't know one [0:27:39]
 I said that so we've got those in place I'm just going to do the same for this one over here as [0:27:49]
 well and then we can move onto this load so we're now ready to animate this as an explosion so we're [0:27:57]
 going to rip this apart and then put it back together again in this load assembly so this [0:28:03]
 exploded assembly work bench allows us to create groups and directions for these to move in [0:28:09]
 I'm only going to be using a few of these tools and I'm going to go into this in more depth [0:28:14]
 in a later video to use this we're going to be using this tool here the create simple group [0:28:20]
 and I'm going to select the faces of the screws or the bolts in the direction that I want to [0:28:29]
 travel so I've selected the top faces of those and this is the direction I want to travel if I [0:28:35]
 select that option there that tool see those moved out and what we have we come down to the [0:28:45]
 bottom out tree view we've got the splose assembly and inside that you'll see a number of [0:28:51]
 simple groups in there so those three all controlled by this one we can change the distance [0:29:00]
 so we can set this say 50 and I'll push it further you'll notice the little dotted line here that [0:29:05]
 shows the direction of travel we can increase animation stats to make it slower so now when I press [0:29:13]
 the play button you can see they move in and out needs two buttons here and if I increase this more [0:29:22]
 to say 60 and you can see that's affected the speed [0:29:34]
 so that's 20 so the revolution's as well we've got that one there that will evolve around the [0:29:50]
 access so for these if I try it not point one it's not going to really work so you can see how [0:29:58]
 they evolved out and they're evolved back in if you want to evolve like these singly then you have [0:30:07]
 to do them singly for the time being I'm not aware of an option that you can actually divide [0:30:13]
 the revolution by all of them so they all revolve around their access if anybody knows about [0:30:19]
 that please let me know but that's show you how that will be applied to a nut so if I take this nut [0:30:26]
 so I'm taking that facing the nut and adding that to the group so it's just that one I got to zero [0:30:34]
 out the revolution of these and then add the revolt to that one so I'm going to add a simple group one [0:30:41]
 and use 0.2 on that with a distance of 50 so go to this simple group and zero out the revolution [0:30:52]
 just back to normal now when I play you'll see that there is rotational nut that's slow that down [0:31:01]
 so you can see the rotation there [0:31:10]
 let's come back to that simple group and just decrease that [0:31:17]
 so we can play with the revolution the distance and animation steps [0:31:28]
 also we've got animation step time here as well this one here [0:31:38]
 so I supply the animation to the other bolts as well so this one [0:31:51]
 simple group and this one simple group [0:31:58]
 to it's the washes and I'm going to use those washes as one single group so I've control [0:32:10]
 selected those using the face direction of travel and we'll do the same on the other side as well [0:32:17]
 so this one this one and this one [0:32:23]
 so those are all added there we've got rotation on this one [0:32:32]
 it's not here if we come down and we're looking for the simple group that nut [0:32:42]
 it's the one with the rotation this whiff actually naming these so we've got the rotation there [0:32:47]
 and we can apply that to the other two so I've selected those three and come in [0:32:57]
 and just reapply so 50 50 and at 0.2 you can see them moving out [0:33:05]
 because we've just applied those to the rest of those and though there's the same [0:33:10]
 value as this one it just gets applied across the free [0:33:12]
 last of all let's move this [0:33:17]
 else of this one and now we've got the full animation of our product [0:33:31]
 pretty simple workbench there's not a lot more tools up here to use but that's the simple [0:33:43]
 way of using it I'll be going to in more depth into this workbench in future videos so I hope you [0:33:48]
