===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 2 - Create a simple model and export to STL in Part Design =====
 Hi, I'm welcome back to part 2 of the beginner's course for free CAD. [0:00:04]
 We're looking at a free CAD from a beginner's perspective, but with emphasis on the fundamentals [0:00:09]
 and workflows. [0:00:10]
 In the last video we looked at how to set up free CAD, some basic preferences and how [0:00:15]
 to use the navigation device with a simple sketch to navigate free CAD to get the best [0:00:20]
 out of your experience. [0:00:21]
 In this video we're modeling something from the ground up and exporting that out to file [0:00:25]
 as STL format. [0:00:27]
 So this has a look at the techniques that we're going to use in this course. [0:00:31]

 And that's at www.patreon.com, 4-sash mango jelly solutions. [0:00:52]
 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:00:56]
 So this is M and the workflow we're going to be using. [0:00:59]
 We're going to be using something called a part design workflow. [0:01:01]
 And this will be used in cooperation with another workbench called the Sketcher. [0:01:05]
 And we're going to be going back and forth from the Sketcher to the part design creating [0:01:10]
 sketches for pants and pockets. [0:01:12]
 And using the part design to actually create those pants and pockets. [0:01:16]
 After that we're going to be using Dressups and the part design to add fillets. [0:01:20]
 So next we're going to be using the finished product and output it as a file as a model [0:01:25]
 to be used somewhere else, saying another 3D package. [0:01:30]
 And this is the object we'll be creating. [0:01:32]
 Now from experience I know I can create this object in a number of different ways. [0:01:37]
 Any new object we come across we need to examine and decide which techniques we're going [0:01:42]
 to use. [0:01:43]
 This involves breaking down the object into its individual parts. [0:01:48]
 So for instance, if we look from the top, we can see we have four holes, a rectangle with [0:01:57]
 curved sides and a rectangle that is extruded out from the center. [0:02:05]
 And also has curves on the edges. [0:02:11]
 It's good idea to have a look at this in individual profiles. [0:02:15]
 So we can see from the left that we just have a T. [0:02:20]
 So in my mind I can model this from the top down without the need to go from the side [0:02:30]
 to add any geometry from the side. [0:02:33]
 I also know that I can take the approach from the left profile this side. [0:02:41]
 And loft profile through this and then curve off the edges. [0:02:50]
 We're going to go from a single plane. [0:02:53]
 So from the top plane and then we'll introduce multiple planes as we go. [0:02:58]
 So we're in free cat. [0:03:00]
 We've got it open and we create new document either from this icon or we can come up to [0:03:05]
 the top left. [0:03:07]
 We'll see that we have two tabs down the bottom, which we can close the start page. [0:03:13]
 We don't need that. [0:03:15]
 This tab is the same name as our current document. [0:03:19]
 That's for a save this document. [0:03:21]
 So I've got to file save. [0:03:25]
 And I'm just going to call it as number one. [0:03:28]
 So we've got our document saved and we can use this dropdown to start our process in the [0:03:32]
 part design. [0:03:33]
 Now in the part design workbench, we have two tabs along the left hand side. [0:03:39]
 We have the model tab that shows a tree view. [0:03:42]
 So each time we add a body or a object to our screen, it will appear here or if we do [0:03:48]
 an action. [0:03:49]
 And then we have the task. [0:03:51]
 Now in the part design, this guides you through the part design process. [0:03:55]
 So it's asking us to create a body. [0:03:57]
 If we click on that, what will happen? [0:03:59]
 Is that will get the next stage greater sketch? [0:04:03]
 If we jump over to the model and click on that, you can see a body has been created with [0:04:08]
 another object inside. [0:04:11]
 And this is invisible. [0:04:12]
 You can see it's grayed out. [0:04:14]
 It's not disabled, it's just invisible. [0:04:17]
 That's now create a sketch. [0:04:20]
 Click on create a sketch. [0:04:22]
 It's going to ask us what plane we want to place this on. [0:04:24]
 So we can start modeling in 2D and convert it to 3D with 3D actions. [0:04:29]
 Let's take a look at our model. [0:04:31]
 We're going to be modeling everything from one plane, the top plane. [0:04:35]
 Now this is known as the xy. [0:04:37]
 It's like you're looking down on your workpiece onto the object. [0:04:41]
 So I can see I need a rectangle with curved edges and holes in each of the corners. [0:04:50]
 So this project we can be creating those curved edges as something known as fillet. [0:04:55]
 These are known as dress up actions and they should be done last of all just to finish off [0:04:59]
 the object. [0:05:00]
 So I need to select a plane. [0:05:01]
 Now I want the xy plane and you can see this xy plane laying here. [0:05:06]
 I'm going to select it from this side. [0:05:08]
 We can select it from the screen if we want, but it's best to select it from here. [0:05:11]
 You can see them highlight as we go over them. [0:05:15]
 Now if we look at the xy plane and look out our navigation cube we can see how it's [0:05:20]
 orientated and they're orientated the same. [0:05:22]
 So top, the xy front is except, etc. [0:05:27]
 Let's hit OK. [0:05:31]
 And what will happen will be thrown into the sketch up. [0:05:34]
 And you'll see that we're looking down from the top. [0:05:38]
 And we're looking onto our workpiece and we've got the green and the red axis x [0:05:44]
 and y. [0:05:45]
 So now we can put some geometry on the screen. [0:05:48]
 If we look at our toolbars, these may not be arranged in this manner. [0:05:53]
 If you want to move these about, you can click on the divider here and drag these into [0:06:00]
 position. [0:06:02]
 So we can drag them where if we want, if we go too far, then these will be shrunk and you'll [0:06:10]
 get this Chevron which we can drop them and get to the other parts in there. [0:06:17]
 If you click on these to undock this window, then we can actually dock this wherever we [0:06:26]
 want. [0:06:27]
 Sometimes it can be a bit awkward to get in this back. [0:06:31]
 And to get it back, best idea is to come over to the left hand side, hold it there for [0:06:35]
 a couple of seconds until you see the window appear and then drop it into place. [0:06:40]
 Now to add any of this geometry, run along here, such as a rectangle or you may see it [0:06:48]
 defaulted as a center drag tango. [0:06:52]
 We just select the item from the screen. [0:06:57]
 And then you'll see the mouse points change to a crosshairs. [0:07:01]
 And underneath that you'll see a red drag tango. [0:07:03]
 So that's the last tool we've selected. [0:07:06]
 It's worth going over to the left hand side and having a look at some of the options here [0:07:10]
 before we start. [0:07:11]
 Let's bring this out a bit. [0:07:14]
 You can see we've got the self-emessage. [0:07:18]
 This will change constantly when we place geometry onto the screen. [0:07:22]
 We've also got the edit controls in here if we expand this out. [0:07:27]
 You can see there's a number of checked options. [0:07:30]
 I've got the auto constraint checked and the avoid redundant auto constraints also checked. [0:07:37]
 That means that if I hover over any of these lines, you'll see an additional icon appear [0:07:42]
 by the right hand side of the rectangle or whatever item you selected from the toolbar. [0:07:49]
 This additional item is a constraint. [0:07:53]
 So if we look and match it to our toolbar you can see we've got the point on line constraint [0:08:00]
 or point on object constraint. [0:08:01]
 And if I hover over this center point, you can see we've got a constraint. [0:08:06]
 This one here. [0:08:09]
 This means when I place this rectangle I can constrain it to anywhere on here. [0:08:15]
 For instance, that's place my pointer over this line. [0:08:20]
 Click and then place the pointer over this line. [0:08:25]
 You'll see a number of red items appear around the object. [0:08:30]
 Then we have constraints at these points. [0:08:33]
 So you can see we've got the point on line constraint and the point on line constraint here. [0:08:38]
 If I did the same here and moved over to the center point, you see we've got a quiz and constraint [0:08:43]
 and I come out and I can drop it wherever I want. [0:08:47]
 That would be constrained to that center there. [0:08:51]
 Hit states get the mouse point back or hit the right mouse button and we've got our point [0:08:56]
 back. [0:08:57]
 We can now manipulate these into position. [0:09:00]
 You can see the constraints are stopping the object from moving from suit certain points. [0:09:09]
 So this point line constraint is keeping it on this vertical axis and the same for the horizontal. [0:09:15]
 If we don't want those, we can click on the constraint and hit the lead on the keyboard. [0:09:22]
 And this one moves us off of that constraint. [0:09:26]
 You can see we've got this constraint here. [0:09:29]
 Another way of actually selecting that is to come down and find the constraint along the left-hand [0:09:34]
 side in the constraint box. [0:09:38]
 And we can click the constraints and you can see the constraints. [0:09:44]
 Here's a quiz and constraint we handed. [0:09:46]
 It's there and they highlighted in green. [0:09:51]
 So that's the one constraint and come up and find that in here. [0:09:57]
 So you can see the constraint there and just hit the lead and therefore we can move this [0:10:02]
 off of that line. [0:10:05]
 These other constraints can be moved as well so we can click on this one and say delete it. [0:10:11]
 And now this isn't kept horizontal. [0:10:14]
 This can have some angle. [0:10:17]
 So that's removed this geometry and I'm going to remove it with a box selection. [0:10:21]
 I'll just shrink this down and I'm going to click into the space. [0:10:25]
 Hold the mouse point around and draw a box around what we have. [0:10:31]
 Everything is highlighted in green. [0:10:34]
 If I want to say just delete everything except for this line here, I just click it again. [0:10:40]
 That turns white and now we can hit delete. [0:10:45]
 Let's get rid of this one as well. [0:10:47]
 Hit delete again. [0:10:48]
 So that's create our rectangle in here. [0:10:51]
 Now I'm going to drop this down and use a different rectangle. [0:10:55]
 The centered rectangle. [0:10:58]
 So you can see we've got the rectangle icon by the side of our mouse pointer and I'm going to hover over [0:11:04]
 this center point here and create a quince and constraint. [0:11:07]
 Click. [0:11:08]
 Now I've got my mouse pointer held down and just going to bring this out and click again. [0:11:15]
 You can see we've got a number of constraints and we've also got some equal to symmetry constraint [0:11:19]
 going across this point. [0:11:21]
 So these two are symmetry constraints. [0:11:23]
 That's found here. [0:11:25]
 I'm going to right click. [0:11:27]
 So I get the mouse pointer back and we can see how that symmetry constraint. [0:11:31]
 If I click on this point and drag it, we can see how everything's kept in symmetry. [0:11:38]
 It's just a symmetry across this center point. [0:11:41]
 That's set some height and width. [0:11:43]
 So I'm going to set one of these lines. [0:11:46]
 This one here and set a width. [0:11:51]
 Also, it's length. [0:11:53]
 Which is a length and I'm going to say about 100 millimeters there. [0:11:58]
 Also, I'm going to set the height. [0:12:00]
 This one here. [0:12:02]
 Set the height. [0:12:04]
 You notice we've got a change behind here. [0:12:07]
 Everything is gone green. [0:12:09]
 Let's see what's just happened. [0:12:10]
 So I'm just going to cancel out here. [0:12:11]
 This is gone back to white. [0:12:14]
 And we're going to scroll up to the top. [0:12:16]
 Notice our silver message has changed. [0:12:20]
 Under constraint, one degrees of freedom. [0:12:24]
 That means this can be actually moved in one degree of freedom. [0:12:31]
 So one direction. [0:12:32]
 I know this is two directions. [0:12:34]
 It's count as one because it's just a long vertical. [0:12:38]
 We can find that degree of freedom by clicking on the one D-O-F here. [0:12:46]
 And you'll see in green the points that are not locked down. [0:12:52]
 So these points aren't locked down. [0:12:55]
 Minute we add a height. [0:13:00]
 So at the moment, I've got the wrong selection because if we look here, okay, [0:13:07]
 you see we've got this line selected. [0:13:09]
 And these two points selected. [0:13:11]
 So it's taking those into selection. [0:13:12]
 So we must click instance space space and then click on this line game and add the height. [0:13:18]
 Everything's gone a bright green behind and we get to that in a minute. [0:13:23]
 That's type in 50 millimeters here enter. [0:13:25]
 What we have is a fully constrained sketch. [0:13:29]
 You can see it's saying fully constrained. [0:13:31]
 This is important in CAD because it means this can't move. [0:13:34]
 So it's not going to move by accident and it won't destroy any geometry. [0:13:39]
 That's placed on top of it. [0:13:40]
 So it's fully constrained now. [0:13:44]
 So let's hit close and see what we have. [0:13:47]
 We've gone back to the part design because we create the sketch from the part design. [0:13:51]
 And we've got this sketch here. [0:13:53]
 Let's go to the model. [0:13:55]
 You can see the sketch has been selected and it's inside the body. [0:13:59]
 So this is known as the active body. [0:14:02]
 If we look at this body and right click, you can see we've got toggle active body. [0:14:08]
 When this is bold, that means it's active. [0:14:13]
 Any sketches I add will get added to the active body. [0:14:18]
 One other thing to look at is the excess cross. [0:14:22]
 So I got to view toggle access cross. [0:14:26]
 You can see our access cross is in the center here. [0:14:30]
 Now this is relevant because it's where we're going to transform this body from. [0:14:35]
 So we can actually transform this body and [0:14:38]
 the handle will be placed in here. [0:14:41]
 So this is the center point of the body. [0:14:43]
 And this is controlled by the sketch. [0:14:46]
 So for double click the sketch, you can see if I add some angle to this. [0:14:51]
 We've got our access cross sitting here. [0:14:57]
 And this is the point of origin where we started this from. [0:15:01]
 So this is the sketch. [0:15:02]
 If we moved geometry over, then our body will be starting here. [0:15:09]
 So the first sketch determined is where the point of rotation is going to be. [0:15:14]
 Let's close this and get back to our model. [0:15:19]
 Now we've got the sketch. [0:15:21]
 It's fully constrained and it's known as a closed sketch. [0:15:26]
 So we can pad a closed sketch in the part design. [0:15:30]
 So padded means a strugeon. [0:15:33]
 So we're going to screw this up using a pad command. [0:15:36]
 Now if we look on the toolbar, we can see a number of different colored icons. [0:15:40]
 So we got red ones here or red and blue. [0:15:43]
 And then we got the yellow ones here. [0:15:46]
 Yellows are additive. [0:15:48]
 Red are subtractive. [0:15:50]
 So if we add in material, like a pad, they're additive. [0:15:55]
 If we move a material away from this, like a pocket, they're subtractive. [0:15:59]
 That's pad this sketch. [0:16:01]
 I can see it's been selected because it's highlighted in green. [0:16:05]
 But it's worth just selecting it from the left hand side here. [0:16:08]
 And using the pad option or coming up to the part design and create an additive feature and pad. [0:16:16]
 On the left hand side in the task, you can see we got another window that's appeared. [0:16:22]
 The pad parameters. [0:16:23]
 And this tells us how this pad is going to be applied to the object. [0:16:28]
 So I want to apply a five millimeter pad to this. [0:16:32]
 If I click off, you can see that's shrunk down to five millimeters now. [0:16:36]
 We've got a number of other options which we're not going to go into, [0:16:39]
 we're just going to keep this simple. [0:16:40]
 Let's hit OK. [0:16:41]
 Now we've got the base for our objects. [0:16:46]
 We're going to create another sketch on top of this to add the holes. [0:16:52]
 Now we could come into the pad and add the holes here. [0:16:57]
 But I'm going to go and click on this face. [0:17:01]
 Now I click once and add a sketch to that face to add the holes. [0:17:05]
 If you double click, you'll notice that the body has been selected. [0:17:12]
 Double click selects the whole object. [0:17:15]
 So just click off and click that face and come up to the sketch icon. [0:17:21]
 Great and sketch and that will add the sketch to that face. [0:17:26]
 You can see the sketch laying across that face. [0:17:29]
 We're still from the top plane looking down. [0:17:32]
 We can see that sketch has been in line with the face. [0:17:36]
 That's that's the geometry. [0:17:37]
 Now for the geometry we want to add our holes going to cross here. [0:17:41]
 So we're going to use the circle. [0:17:43]
 I will go to pocket these holes so we can create these circles as voids in this piece of material. [0:17:51]
 I'm just going to click pull out the circle. [0:17:54]
 Click again and we're just going to place a number of circles in the approximate vicinity of [0:18:03]
 the corners. That's add some constraints to this. [0:18:07]
 So I want 5mm holes. Now I can come in and click this hole or this circle. [0:18:13]
 And add a diameter constraint. [0:18:18]
 So constraint diameter. [0:18:20]
 Like so. [0:18:22]
 And we can set that to, let's see, 10mm is so 10mm for holes. [0:18:28]
 So that's 10mm. [0:18:30]
 But I wouldn't then go and set all these to 10mm because [0:18:34]
 this may change and I want all these to stay in relation to this one. [0:18:39]
 There's two ways of doing this. We can set the first one and then click [0:18:43]
 to select. So I'm just clicking on all the edges and coming up and using the [0:18:50]
 equality constraint and that sets those all equal to this one. [0:18:55]
 I'm just going to come up to edit and undo. [0:18:58]
 Another way of doing this, that's quick on this constraint here and just hit the delete [0:19:04]
 so that the delete that constraint is to select the wall and then use the radius again. [0:19:11]
 So let's open and come up and set the radius. [0:19:22]
 And we set that one to 10mm. You see the equality has been placed all the way across there. [0:19:30]
 So these are all equal now but they're still not constraint down and they're not in the right place. [0:19:36]
 So we need to do that. We're going to click on top. [0:19:39]
 So we're looking directly down on here and I want to reference the box underneath. [0:19:47]
 This pad underneath. To do that we need to pull in the geometry. [0:19:52]
 Now because if we go to the model we can see that we've got a number of items that's added here [0:20:01]
 so we've got the pad that's been added and the sketch underneath. [0:20:05]
 We can see they're in the same body so anything in the same body we have access to. [0:20:11]
 Let's click on this the work on here the external geometry tool. [0:20:16]
 This allows us to pick up points. So we'll hover over the point here or here you can see the [0:20:24]
 vertex is been highlighted and also the edges. If I click on that vertex here I've pulled in that [0:20:34]
 I can pull in more we're just going to pull in one for the time being. [0:20:37]
 We press the right mouse button to get the points back and we'll come back over to task and see what we have. [0:20:46]
 If I scroll down to the bottom let's bring this out of it. [0:20:50]
 You can see we've got elements and we've got a purple cross. [0:20:58]
 If I drop down the mode to external we can see that point five five point is a standard geometry. [0:21:07]
 Let's be important. This one here we can use that in our constraints. [0:21:13]
 So I'm going to click the center point of this circle and this point and use horizontal distance [0:21:23]
 of 10mm and also do this again. So I'm going to pull this constraint out and push it to the side [0:21:30]
 and this one and this one and use a vertical constraint again of 10mm. [0:21:41]
 You can see this one's gone green so it's fully locked down. This one is fully constrained but the [0:21:47]
 others aren't so we've got constraint geometry but unconstrained geometry around the outside. [0:21:51]
 That's start constraining these geometries now. [0:21:55]
 So I want to slap this point and this point and keep them in line so this keeps in line with [0:22:02]
 this one. We could go through and slap this point and pull in geometry from external source, [0:22:09]
 our external pad and do the same but it ends up getting messy so we want [0:22:15]
 this day that in constraints these are called that in constraints because they've got [0:22:20]
 data added to them. The least that in constraints a lot more easy to control and that makes our [0:22:26]
 sketch a lot more neater. So to put these in the line with whichever we're going to use the horizontal [0:22:32]
 and vertical constraints. Now you probably saw those in previous pad we had lines that went here [0:22:39]
 and here they're not only just for lines they can be used for points as well. So these are at [0:22:44]
 distance so I can take this point and this point and add a vertical constraint in there and if I [0:22:53]
 move that they all move together and we can do the same with this point and this point will horizontal [0:23:01]
 these move now and this one now I want to do the same with this point and this point in here [0:23:10]
 if we have trouble with all these trying to get this point can't read see in there. Let's click [0:23:16]
 off to answer that that. Let's click and constrain this one here and come up to it and there's a tick [0:23:25]
 by the side of it. If I uncheck that it hines it from screen. Let's do it with this one as well [0:23:33]
 that's high that one. Now I can see this point in here so I'm going to click it and click this one [0:23:41]
 and keep those in line horizontal constraint and we're going to do the same with this point [0:23:46]
 and this point and keep those in line. So I shouldn't be able to move this left or right but I can [0:23:54]
 still move it up and down. Let's have a look at our degrees of freedom so we've got two degrees of [0:24:01]
 so we've got up and down here and we have left and right here and if I click you can see these [0:24:11]
 have been highlighted so we need to lock these down somehow to do that we're going to do the reverse [0:24:19]
 here so we're going to do this one over here so that's bringing the external geometry and bring [0:24:28]
 this point. Hit escape or press the right mouse button to get a mouse point back and select these two [0:24:33]
 points. Now watch the under constraint degrees of freedom. Place a height. It's changed to one now. [0:24:45]
 So that's type in 10 and you notice this one's gone green so we've got one degree of freedom. Let's [0:24:55]
 click that and you'll see these two points show. Unslat them, press select in space so that's [0:25:01]
 let this point and this point and place some horizontal length in there and set that to 10 and you can [0:25:12]
 see already it's fully constrained and everything gets green so here okay and we've got our constraints [0:25:20]
 which bring those out. Let's come back over and I'm just going to show those ones that I made [0:25:32]
 invisible. So for the constraint let's come up and hit close and if I click off you can see the [0:25:41]
 sketch has been added to that so you can see the white sketch if I add some rotation to here. [0:25:46]
 We want to create pockets with this sketch so we want to pocket through to create the holes for this item. [0:25:54]
 You can see that if we follow the body down we've got a green arrow and this is known as the [0:26:05]
 tip. So this green arrow there it's the tip it's the very last action. So let's select the sketch [0:26:13]
 and come up to the pocket or come up to part design. It's a subtractive feature so come [0:26:20]
 down to the subtractive features and create a pocket. You can see those pockets are gone through [0:26:27]
 5mm. Now if we set this to say 1mm we'll get a pocket that only goes part away through. [0:26:34]
 Now if we drop the tight down and go to first that takes us up to and past that first face. [0:26:44]
 So it's gone all the way through the bottom which is what we want. That's it okay. [0:26:50]
 We get another action in our model tab and you see the little green arrow sitting there and that's [0:26:59]
 the pocket at any time we can come in and change this so I can sit back to dimension and that'll [0:27:05]
 change that pocket there. Let's cancel out and now we've created the base for our model. [0:27:14]
 So looking back to this we can see we've got this base here. We have an applied [0:27:19]
 the filets because that's a dress-up feature and we do that last of all there's a reason why we do that [0:27:26]
 last. Now I'm going to concentrate on this feature. I can do that still from my [0:27:34]
 name from the top plane. So we look at this we can see it's just a rectangle and that [0:27:39]
 rectangle has been a streuded upwards. If we ignore the filet here we can see that the rectangle [0:27:49]
 is the same width as the base. So back in freakhead and we're going to model that feature. [0:27:57]
 Make sure you're saving regularly as well and I have to use a control us for file save and we're [0:28:04]
 going to start modeling a rectangle in here. Now for this we're going to do the same. [0:28:09]
 Make sure nothing's selected and select the top face and we're going to click on the sketch icon [0:28:15]
 create sketch. Now I'm going to pull this in geometry because I want to bust it up against this line [0:28:20]
 here. So I'm going to pull in this line and this line and you can see those are coming and we scroll [0:28:28]
 down to the bottom we can see the two lines of pulled in from the base. Let's create a rectangle [0:28:36]
 so I'm going to come out to the rectangle. This time I'm just going to use a standard rectangle [0:28:39]
 click on that and I'm going to use the older constraints and hover over this line. [0:28:44]
 Point of line constraint click once and move the mouse over the other side and again use the [0:28:51]
 point of line constraint. You see it's gone over this hole which doesn't matter for the time being [0:28:57]
 because what we're going to do is make symmetry across this line here. To do that press the right [0:29:04]
 mouse button, look at the mouse point back and click this point and this point [0:29:10]
 and these two points we want centered on this line. So select the two points first and then select [0:29:17]
 the line and use the symmetry constraint. It's gone orange this means it's over constraint [0:29:27]
 if we go out to the top you can see we've got redundant constraints and it's saying number seven. [0:29:35]
 What may happen is that you may get the report view pop up here and if you remember back to when [0:29:44]
 we set the preferences you need to go in there and uncheck the show report view on errors and that's [0:29:51]
 at the beginning of the video where we went through the set end. That's click on that redundant constraint [0:29:57]
 number seven and hit the delete key. You can see that's removed that redundant constraint but it's [0:30:05]
 still not fully constrained we still got one degree of freedom which is this way. I'm going to [0:30:11]
 select one of these lines, doesn't matter which so this line I'm going to set the distance [0:30:17]
 and I'm going to set that one to five millimeters and hit OK. We've now got that sketch on the surface [0:30:25]
 and we're going to pad that sketch so hit close make sure the sketch is selected and use the pad [0:30:35]
 again it's asking us for the length let's have a look at this length. Now I want something like 25 [0:30:44]
 millimeters for the length so we can see that length is in there and now what do we start to take [0:30:52]
 your shape? Let's hit OK. Now we've got the shape of our model but we need to finish it up. [0:31:03]
 Let's compare this with our model at the moment so we've done this part and this part with the [0:31:12]
 we now need to add the curvature going across here. To do that we're going to use something called [0:31:18]
 dress up and this is a finishing feature so this is thing you should use last of all you shouldn't [0:31:24]
 place geometry on top of this because this is used as a way of making the object look more [0:31:31]
 separately pleasing and also to clean up any sharp edges to save from injury. [0:31:35]
 We're going to bring this around and look at the edges. So the first one I'm going to do is this [0:31:44]
 one here we're going to do curvature that cleans up this edge. To do that I'm going to select [0:31:52]
 the edges so this edge that runs across here and this edge that runs across here. Control [0:32:00]
 select those I'm holding on the control cleats. Select one hold on the control cleats. [0:32:04]
 Select the other and come up to part design. Apply it a dress up feature and apply a fillet. [0:32:13]
 This curves these edges off. Now if we come down to the left hand side we can see we've got [0:32:21]
 the edges and the radius and we can decrease this and see what happens in the right hand side. [0:32:27]
 If we go too far the flip will go into error so if I click again you can see it's disappeared [0:32:34]
 and this has gone into error. So if I hit OK now you can see we've got failed to create fillet [0:32:40]
 and we've got the report view as popped up. Now we'll can turn that off by going to the [0:32:48]
 edit preferences output window and you see I've got show report view on warnings, unchecked and show [0:32:58]
 report view on error. That's unchecked that and OK. Do you notice that one and hit OK? [0:33:07]
 See it's come up failed to create fillet which is absolutely fine and we'll got no report view [0:33:13]
 that's bringing this fillet now. So 24 I'm going to go down to say 20 and hit OK. [0:33:22]
 We've now got that fillet there. Let's do the same with these edges. This time I'm just going to [0:33:31]
 select one and click the fillet tool from the toolbar this time. You can see that edges added in there [0:33:40]
 and I'm going to set this to 10 millimeters so I'll tighten 10 and I'll click off. [0:33:45]
 I does me but I want to add more edges to do that we click add with low K-r-h and click it [0:33:57]
 and come around again. This add is still slatted so we can just click on that edge. [0:34:05]
 If we accidentally add an edge, say this one then we can just remove it from here. [0:34:11]
 Hit remove and we have to select the edge so click and it disappears. [0:34:19]
 Anytime we can just tweak the radius to see what it looks like. [0:34:27]
 We'll add one more. Make sure that it's being selected and click and just tweak the radius [0:34:39]
 and we can see that's all in then nicely. [0:34:45]
 See OK. See what we got one further there and then the next further. [0:34:53]
 At any time we can see what our work is like at any stage we can see these are all being hidden [0:35:00]
 but we can bring that back by pressing the spacebar. You can see that our tip action has been [0:35:06]
 grayed out but this is still our tip and we can see the fillets are no longer there and as we move [0:35:13]
 up we can see how this object has been built. Click on the last of that press the spacebar. [0:35:20]
 At any time we can double click and adjust this. [0:35:24]
 So this adds the last fillet. So we're going to click on this line inside [0:35:31]
 and add the fillet. [0:35:36]
 And we'll increase the fillet to about 5 millimeters. [0:35:44]
 It's added enough one on the other side. Click add. [0:35:47]
 Click the edge and hit OK. [0:35:53]
 We've now completed the build. [0:35:59]
 The Zeminine and the Tree View you can see we've got a pad. [0:36:06]
 And inside that we have a sketch. This is the sketch that's been built by. [0:36:11]
 I just press the spacebar on there just to show where that sketch is. [0:36:15]
 And to show it on the screen. [0:36:17]
 It's press the spacebar on the pocket and come into the sketch. [0:36:24]
 I press the spacebar on that so you can see the sketch. [0:36:27]
 You can white around those holes. [0:36:30]
 Same for this pad. [0:36:33]
 The sketch we see the pad there. [0:36:38]
 And lastly we've got the fillets. [0:36:44]
 Press the spacebar. [0:36:45]
 As we go through and we can see what's happened. [0:36:50]
 We can hide the sketch is by clicking on the sketch from the screen as well. [0:36:56]
 We'll hide it on the left hand side and press the spacebar. [0:36:59]
 So the next thing is to export this out as something like an STL. [0:37:09]
 To last a 3D print it or use it somewhere else saying enough 3D program. [0:37:14]
 To do that we need to select the last action from the left hand side here. [0:37:22]
 So this one here and we just got to file and export. [0:37:28]
 And I'll ask us the file name and also the file type. [0:37:34]
 Now if we come down we can see we've got STL which I'm going to use. [0:37:40]
 Click on that. [0:37:41]
 We need to specify the extension because we've got two extensions here. [0:37:45]
 We've got STL and IST. [0:37:46]
 So we need to specify that. [0:37:49]
 So just type in.stl and we can save it. [0:37:52]
 That's exported out. [0:37:55]
 We can even export out. [0:37:58]
 This one, this for that. [0:38:01]
 The one without the curve edges here. [0:38:04]
 And we'll click on it file, export. [0:38:09]
 And we've got, what if you let 0.01.stl and we can save that as well. [0:38:17]
 I'm going to create a new document so we can have a look at those STL files. [0:38:23]
 Click on the new document. [0:38:24]
 We've got two open so you can see we've got these on one here and the unnamed. [0:38:30]
 And can't to file, import. [0:38:34]
 And that's find our STL file. [0:38:37]
 Here they are. [0:38:39]
 So I've highlighted both those using the shift to the control and here open. [0:38:46]
 So we've imported two STL files. [0:38:49]
 I'm going to click on the first one to press the spacebar. [0:38:53]
 You can see this is the one with the fillet in here. [0:38:57]
 And we're just press the spacebar again and click on this one. [0:39:02]
 Press the spacebar and this is the one with the fillet. [0:39:06]
 So that's it for video 2. [0:39:09]
 We've created an object on a single plane and now we're going to move on to video 3. [0:39:14]
 We're going to create an object on multiple planes and also output to a technical drawing. [0:39:18]
