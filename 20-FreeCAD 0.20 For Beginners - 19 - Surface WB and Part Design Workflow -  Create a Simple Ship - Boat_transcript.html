===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 19 - Surface WB and Part Design Workflow -  Create a Simple Ship - Boat =====
 I have one and welcome back to another episode of the Lennie Free Cat for beginners, where we teach the fundamentals of free cat, whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:08]
 In today's tutorial we're going to be learning a surface and base feature workflow. Now the base feature is in the part design. [0:00:15]
 We've touched on surface in before, but we're going to pull this together in more practical workflow. [0:00:20]
 We're going to start off in the sketch up. From there we're going to create a skeleton. Now in this case I've chosen a very simple skeleton to create a rudimentary ship. [0:00:30]
 From there we're going to be using both the surface and the part workbench. [0:00:35]
 With those two workbenches we're going to be creating surfaces against that skeleton. [0:00:42]
 So finally, booting them all together into a solid object. So we're going to be working with that workflow. [0:00:49]
 We're going to be making a number of solids against different parts of that skeleton. [0:00:54]
 Now we could do it only one go, but we're going to keep this simple taking this step by step. [0:00:59]
 From there we're going to be using a part design workflow. [0:01:03]
 So we're going to import that objects into part design workbench. [0:01:07]
 Buy something known as a base feature. This allows us to bridge that workflow, [0:01:13]
 taking the solid from the part and surface workbench and using it in the part design. [0:01:19]
 We've sketched against those faces of that object along with pads and pockets to create the end result. [0:01:27]
 So I hope you enjoyed these videos, and let's have a look at this workflow. [0:01:32]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:01:57]
 So we're freecat. The first thing we're going to do is create a new document. [0:02:00]
 And I'm going to come over to the sketcher. Now we're going to be using a surface workbench, [0:02:05]
 sketcher, and a part workbench workflow. [0:02:09]
 Not using the part design because we're building this as a multi-body object. [0:02:13]
 And we've got other workbenches involved as well. We've got the surface workbench here. [0:02:17]
 I can use the part design afterwards to pull this in as a base feature and build upon that. [0:02:23]
 But this is just going to get the basics of the ship down first to shape. [0:02:28]
 Go into the sketcher and what we're going to do is sketch the top shape of the ship. [0:02:34]
 Great new sketch on the on the xy plane. [0:02:37]
 We're not worried too much about the dimensions. [0:02:40]
 We're just looking at shape for the time being just to get that technique and allow you to understand the actual workflow. [0:02:49]
 I'm going to create two arcs. Now I'm using the endpoint at R. [0:02:53]
 Let's want to here. I'll draw this down. We can find it endpoint to our endpoint. [0:02:58]
 And the two arcs are going to be the ends of the ship. [0:03:03]
 So I'm going to connect one arc to horizontal line, like so. [0:03:10]
 And the other arc is going to be curved for it. This means you can see what happens when we do the surface in against different surfaces. [0:03:19]
 Because it'll be a different set of actions to surface this one compared with this one. [0:03:24]
 So I want these symmetrical cross here. So I'm going to take the two arc centers. [0:03:30]
 So this is the arc center for this one and this is the arc center for this one. [0:03:37]
 And we can play so symmetrical to that line. [0:03:40]
 So click one, click the other and then click the horizontal line and use the symmetry constraint. [0:03:47]
 Got those there. [0:03:50]
 And that's make sure that this point is on that line. [0:03:54]
 So take the middle, take the center line and use a point on my constraint. [0:03:58]
 Now I'm going to keep it simple and just place an arc between here from here to here. [0:04:03]
 I'm just going to place an arc and the same on the other side from that point to that point. [0:04:10]
 I'm not going to worry about tangency across there. [0:04:13]
 We just keep in things simple. [0:04:17]
 You can make more arcs if you want something a bit more complicated. [0:04:21]
 I'm going to take these two points and place them in line with vertical constraint. [0:04:28]
 And the same with these two points as well. [0:04:32]
 But with constraint. [0:04:35]
 And now we can just adjust the shape to what we see for it. [0:04:39]
 So I'm going to want something like that. [0:04:42]
 And then hit close. [0:04:44]
 So we've got the top of the ship. [0:04:48]
 I'm going to create arcs coming from these two points downwards. [0:04:53]
 Now the thing is I need to get to these two points first. [0:04:58]
 Now there's an easy way of doing this. [0:05:00]
 And I'm going to use a little trick with this top sketch. [0:05:04]
 I'm going to place a line from here. [0:05:08]
 To here. [0:05:10]
 Making sure it touches to this line here. [0:05:13]
 We've got some problems with redundancy constraints. [0:05:16]
 I click that. [0:05:17]
 Hit the leaks. [0:05:18]
 We have the horizontal constraint. [0:05:20]
 And what we would do is take these two points and keep them in vertical alignment. [0:05:26]
 What this last we need to do is that I want to attach a sketch to the right side. [0:05:34]
 Bring this around here. [0:05:37]
 To create these arcs. [0:05:38]
 And I want to start them at these points. [0:05:40]
 These two points. [0:05:42]
 By placing this line in here. [0:05:44]
 I can click on that line. [0:05:47]
 Still in the sketch. [0:05:48]
 And create a sketch. [0:05:51]
 Now it's going to say normal to edge. [0:05:53]
 So the sketch is going to be facing normal. [0:05:56]
 So along this edge. [0:05:58]
 So we'll be sketching along the right direction. [0:06:02]
 As you can see. [0:06:03]
 But it's places on this point here. [0:06:06]
 So what we do. [0:06:08]
 We close the sketch. [0:06:09]
 Though it's normal to edge. [0:06:11]
 We'll adjust that. [0:06:13]
 Still keeping it normal to edge. [0:06:16]
 We'll add enough reference. [0:06:18]
 To reference to. [0:06:19]
 And we want to select this vertex. [0:06:22]
 This one here. [0:06:24]
 It's going to change to plane by three points. [0:06:27]
 Click on normal to edge gain. [0:06:29]
 And hit OK. [0:06:30]
 And click off. [0:06:31]
 Now when we come into this sketch. [0:06:34]
 What you'll see is the sketch has moved to that point. [0:06:38]
 Which is in line with these two points. [0:06:41]
 So exactly what we want. [0:06:43]
 So it's almost like a piece of construction geometry. [0:06:46]
 That's visible. [0:06:47]
 It saves us creating the sketch and then moving it to that point. [0:06:52]
 And I want it in line with these points here. [0:06:55]
 Because I'm going to pull that geometry in. [0:06:58]
 So I'm going to use external geometry tool and pull that point in. [0:07:03]
 And then click on that. [0:07:04]
 That points come in. [0:07:06]
 Did the same on the other side. [0:07:08]
 So we've got those two points. [0:07:11]
 Word of warning. [0:07:13]
 If you see this. [0:07:15]
 If you get end up with two points here and two points here. [0:07:18]
 That means you've clicked on this line. [0:07:21]
 So it's pulled in that point. [0:07:23]
 And also it's pulled in the point over here. [0:07:26]
 It doesn't really matter as long as we use this point here. [0:07:30]
 All can do is just hit a skate. [0:07:31]
 Click on that line and delete. [0:07:33]
 And that's gone. [0:07:36]
 So now I'm looking at the shape of the front of the ship. [0:07:41]
 So I can come into the right. [0:07:44]
 And I'm going to use the endpoint and endpoint arc. [0:07:49]
 And connect up. [0:07:51]
 We all to constraints on. [0:07:52]
 It's a coincidence at that point. [0:07:54]
 And come down and attach it to that vertical line. [0:07:58]
 And add some arc into there like so. [0:08:03]
 I'm going to do the same for the other side. [0:08:06]
 Using this one. [0:08:07]
 And this point now. [0:08:09]
 But a point in line. [0:08:10]
 I want a question. [0:08:12]
 Don't get a question. [0:08:13]
 Well, we can just slap those two. [0:08:15]
 And use the question constraint up here. [0:08:18]
 So we've got that there. [0:08:20]
 I'm going to make sure that these two points are symmetrical to this line. [0:08:28]
 Gradonic constraint there. [0:08:30]
 Let's delete that. [0:08:31]
 We didn't really need that by using symmetrical constraints. [0:08:35]
 And what we can do is adjust that where's going to be. [0:08:40]
 So I'm going to go for something around about here. [0:08:47]
 Might be a bit too far so let's bring this up. [0:08:51]
 Something like that. [0:08:54]
 Take clothes. [0:08:56]
 And we can see that's in there. [0:09:00]
 Now that's creating another sketch. [0:09:02]
 This time, I'm going to come round. [0:09:05]
 And I'm going to sketch a curve that connects these two up. [0:09:09]
 So what we're doing is building up a sketch skeleton of the ship. [0:09:13]
 So from the front. [0:09:16]
 It's a crit sketch. [0:09:18]
 We're looking on the X-set plane. [0:09:21]
 So the X-set plane. [0:09:24]
 Okay. [0:09:26]
 But bring in some geometry. [0:09:28]
 Use the standard geometry tool. [0:09:30]
 And bring in this point. [0:09:32]
 They see we've got the line. [0:09:33]
 If we click it, we'll get that point there. [0:09:35]
 That's fine. [0:09:36]
 I'm not going to use it. [0:09:38]
 And that point there. [0:09:39]
 And we use the M point of remark. [0:09:42]
 And connect our those two. [0:09:47]
 And make the arc that we want. [0:09:50]
 Those two points are connecting it. [0:09:52]
 So I'm going to take both of those. [0:09:54]
 And use the Quinscent constraint. [0:09:58]
 So that's in there. [0:10:02]
 We're still sketching along this way. [0:10:07]
 So I'm going to create the line now. [0:10:09]
 Do you want to arc or do I just want to line? [0:10:12]
 That's just place a line in the here. [0:10:14]
 So from here to somewhere over here. [0:10:18]
 I'm going to pull in this point to keep in line with that one. [0:10:23]
 To pull in this point here. [0:10:26]
 And we're going to take these two points. [0:10:28]
 And keep them in line with a vertical constraint. [0:10:31]
 Those are in line now. [0:10:33]
 That's close that. [0:10:34]
 So you can see how this is developing. [0:10:38]
 It's not the true shape of a ship. [0:10:41]
 But gives you an idea of the workflow that we'll be using. [0:10:46]
 Now I'm going to create some curvature between these two points. [0:10:52]
 One thing is if we look at the top sketch. [0:10:55]
 We've got no center point to use. [0:10:58]
 So before I created this line with this center point. [0:11:02]
 It's one here. [0:11:03]
 We've got nothing to attach it to on this side. [0:11:07]
 And I need some kind of line in here. [0:11:10]
 So what I could do is add a point. [0:11:12]
 Or when I go into the sketch. [0:11:14]
 I'll hook on that sketch. [0:11:18]
 I can come in and use a line. [0:11:23]
 And attach it to this arc. [0:11:26]
 Point of line constraint and come out. [0:11:29]
 To about here. [0:11:31]
 Now we're going to need this point on this line. [0:11:35]
 We're going to point to line constraint. [0:11:38]
 And also we're going to take this point and this point. [0:11:42]
 And keep the inverse coordinate alignment. [0:11:46]
 So we've got those there. [0:11:48]
 That will move the end of the ship as you can see. [0:11:52]
 So we're going to adjust that. [0:11:55]
 If I hit close now. [0:11:57]
 I can create my sketch again. [0:11:59]
 It's here like we did before. [0:12:01]
 So that's zoom in. [0:12:03]
 Click on that line. [0:12:06]
 And create the sketch. [0:12:09]
 Normal to edge. [0:12:10]
 So this will be in the center of the sketch. [0:12:13]
 Going forwards. [0:12:14]
 Okay. [0:12:15]
 So now we're in our sketch. [0:12:17]
 You can see where we are. [0:12:19]
 We're right on that point. [0:12:20]
 We need to be on this point. [0:12:22]
 But I'm going to start sketching in here anyway. [0:12:25]
 And then move the sketch. [0:12:28]
 That way we can see what happens when we change the attachment mode. [0:12:31]
 Okay. [0:12:32]
 You see important geometry. [0:12:33]
 And bring in this point. [0:12:35]
 This point. [0:12:36]
 And also this point. [0:12:41]
 That's projected forward. [0:12:44]
 So this is where the sketch is going to be. [0:12:47]
 It's going to be seen on these points in a moment. [0:12:50]
 That's the geometry in here. [0:12:51]
 So I'm going to come in. [0:12:52]
 I'm going to hit the escape. [0:12:53]
 I'm using the endpoint. [0:12:54]
 And then we're going to bring in the other side. [0:12:56]
 And we're going to put the other side. [0:12:58]
 And add in the arcs. [0:13:03]
 And this one. [0:13:09]
 Now I've got those arcs in there. [0:13:11]
 Let's make sure that these two half-equality. [0:13:18]
 And I'll hit close. [0:13:21]
 So we can see how low set. [0:13:24]
 Now if we change the map mode coming here, [0:13:27]
 we'll normalize at the moment. [0:13:29]
 So this sketch here, sketch edge 7. [0:13:32]
 Let's click on reference and select this vertex. [0:13:36]
 So coming and select this vertex here. [0:13:39]
 So we can go into error because our attachment mode has changed. [0:13:44]
 Change the wave and the water edge. [0:13:46]
 So click on the water edge. [0:13:48]
 Okay. [0:13:49]
 Click off. [0:13:51]
 And what you see is that has now moved and connect up to these points. [0:13:56]
 There's one last arc we need to add. [0:14:02]
 And we need to add this arc on this side. [0:14:07]
 This is come around. [0:14:09]
 Look at the rear. [0:14:10]
 Exet plane. [0:14:11]
 So we need a new sketch on that. [0:14:13]
 Make sure nothing's selected. [0:14:14]
 New sketch. [0:14:16]
 Exet. [0:14:17]
 Okay. [0:14:18]
 Let's just round the other way. [0:14:20]
 But that's fine. [0:14:22]
 I see you in and bring in the geometry. [0:14:25]
 So now we can bring in this point here, which is that line. [0:14:32]
 So that line we added. [0:14:34]
 It's put in the whole line, but that's absolutely fine. [0:14:37]
 That's to help us get that sketch in there. [0:14:39]
 It's also helped us to bring in that center point. [0:14:43]
 And we're bringing in this point here. [0:14:46]
 Now I'll put it in up bringing in line because I can't get it. [0:14:49]
 But that's fine. [0:14:51]
 So as we go that point, and we add the endpoint and remember. [0:14:54]
 The endpoint and the endpoint are between these two. [0:14:58]
 Like so. [0:14:59]
 I'll see you can be much more cleaner with your geometry and your constraints. [0:15:05]
 We've started to get that shaping there. [0:15:09]
 It's not as that to ship shape, but it's close enough for what we're doing. [0:15:15]
 As it closed. [0:15:17]
 And see what we've got. [0:15:19]
 So we've got this shape here. [0:15:21]
 Now we're going to do some surfacing. [0:15:23]
 It's going to save this. [0:15:26]
 So now we've got a skeleton of the rudimentary ship. [0:15:30]
 That's trying to surface this now. [0:15:33]
 We're going to be using the surface workbench. [0:15:35]
 Let's come around to the surface workbench and start adding surfaces. [0:15:41]
 We're going to be using the fill in tool this one here. [0:15:45]
 So we click on that or come to surface fill in. [0:15:49]
 We can start adding edges. [0:15:52]
 That starts with this one. [0:15:55]
 So I'm going to create a number of solids. [0:15:59]
 So we can take it slowly so we can understand in how the surface workbench works. [0:16:04]
 One thing I'm about doing is creating a number of solids from here. [0:16:09]
 So you get an idea of how to use them for different applications as well. [0:16:13]
 Let's click add an edge. [0:16:15]
 Now I'm going to take this edge and I'm looking for the next connecting edge. [0:16:21]
 So I'll fall this down. [0:16:23]
 The next connecting edge is this one. [0:16:25]
 Or if I follow this up, it's this one. [0:16:28]
 So add edge gain. [0:16:30]
 Click this one. [0:16:32]
 Click this one. [0:16:34]
 So we've got that surface in there. [0:16:37]
 Let's hit OK. [0:16:39]
 So that's our first surface done. [0:16:42]
 Now I could use symmetry against this surface to bring it over to the other side. [0:16:48]
 Because it's going to be as that is saying and it will be more logical to do that. [0:16:52]
 But I'm going to follow the same process on the other side if we do get into trouble then we use symmetry. [0:16:58]
 So just to base it mirror there. [0:16:59]
 I'm going to click on that surface and press the space bar. [0:17:03]
 So don't get confused what edges to that. [0:17:06]
 Again, I'm going to use a surface in tool. [0:17:09]
 I'm going to add an edge. [0:17:11]
 I'm going to follow the same process. [0:17:13]
 I'm going to take this edge and then we took the top edge and then we took this edge. [0:17:21]
 So we've got that one in there. [0:17:25]
 See, OK. [0:17:27]
 So now we've got both surfaces there. [0:17:31]
 I'm going to create a root surface to close this surface up. [0:17:37]
 So what's going to probably happen is that we're creating a root surface and then we're going to have the root surface which create the edge. [0:17:44]
 And then we've got four edges to use to close up the back. [0:17:47]
 That's all of that process. [0:17:49]
 I'm going to first click on this sketch, press the space bar to hide it. [0:17:53]
 And I'm also going to hide the sketch on this side as well. [0:17:57]
 So I'm going to hide this one down here, press the space bar. [0:18:01]
 And I've got this other sketch here, press the space bar. [0:18:04]
 So we just got these two surfaces here. [0:18:08]
 You could close up the whole ship if you wanted to, but I'm just going to do it a bit by bit. [0:18:14]
 Let's come over to the part, what about edge. [0:18:17]
 And let the two surfaces close. [0:18:20]
 Because these are in line, I should be able to select this edge. [0:18:24]
 Control select the average and use a rule surface across there. [0:18:28]
 If that doesn't work, I'll get a curve in here then use the other surface. [0:18:33]
 The other surface this side. [0:18:36]
 So we've got that in there. [0:18:38]
 Now we need to come back to the surface workbench. [0:18:43]
 And apply that to these edges as well. [0:18:49]
 So using the fill in tool, add edge, and click one edge, click the other. [0:18:56]
 And then find the click and last edge. [0:18:59]
 See we've got a problem if I hit OK, it's going to say failed create from constraints. [0:19:05]
 That's OK that. [0:19:07]
 And cancel that and start that one again. [0:19:10]
 So new surface and that's pick. [0:19:14]
 This edge, this one and then the top one. [0:19:18]
 Put them in a different order. [0:19:20]
 There we go. [0:19:21]
 So we've got that in. [0:19:22]
 That's OK. [0:19:24]
 Now we've got them in there. [0:19:25]
 We can refer this to a solid. [0:19:27]
 That's come over to the part workbench. [0:19:31]
 We're going to compound these together. [0:19:34]
 So that means it will make a group of these as a compound object. [0:19:39]
 Control click all of the surfaces. [0:19:42]
 If we work our way around the object, control click on the surfaces, [0:19:45]
 then we don't have to drill into this preview and click the surfaces from there. [0:19:50]
 Go on to part and come down to compound and make compound. [0:19:56]
 We have got compound object. [0:19:59]
 Click on the compound object, come to that to part and convert the solid. [0:20:04]
 We now have a solid. [0:20:06]
 The compound is still available. [0:20:08]
 Click on that press the space button. [0:20:11]
 We have our solid object and we know it's solid by adding, say, a sphere. [0:20:18]
 Coming in right click and transform and that's sphere. [0:20:23]
 Push it up against the shape. [0:20:29]
 Hit OK. [0:20:31]
 Click on the one we want to keep. [0:20:33]
 Control click on the one we want to remove and use in the cut. [0:20:38]
 We get that sphere cut away from there. [0:20:42]
 So this is now a solid. [0:20:44]
 So you can see in there that it's solid all the way through. [0:20:48]
 That's the lead that cut. [0:20:50]
 And the leads. [0:20:51]
 The sphere. [0:20:56]
 We're going to do the same on the other side. [0:20:59]
 So let's come over to the other side. [0:21:02]
 And we've got a different shape here. [0:21:04]
 This is going to use a different method. [0:21:06]
 We're still going to be using the filling surface. [0:21:08]
 Let's bring back our sketches. [0:21:10]
 We only need the top one. [0:21:13]
 And that's come over to the surface web edge. [0:21:17]
 And start surfacing this model. [0:21:21]
 We're using the filling tool again and adding an edge. [0:21:27]
 And click this edge. [0:21:30]
 I'm not going to click the center because we have this curve here. [0:21:34]
 This center line is going to guide the curve. [0:21:38]
 So add another edge by clicking the other edge. [0:21:42]
 And then click this top edge like so. [0:21:45]
 We have the curvature. [0:21:47]
 But we don't have the full culture of this line. [0:21:52]
 So you can see how it's going down to the bottom. [0:21:55]
 We moved down. [0:21:56]
 We've got these edge constraints. [0:21:58]
 To click on the edge constraints. [0:22:00]
 And bring this up. [0:22:02]
 So in the edge constraints, these will guide the lines. [0:22:05]
 So add edge. [0:22:07]
 And click on this curve. [0:22:11]
 It pulls that curve out. [0:22:14]
 So that curve surface has been pulled out. [0:22:16]
 We've got some finer adjustments to make. [0:22:19]
 And that's come up here. [0:22:21]
 Okay. [0:22:22]
 Find the surface has been created. [0:22:24]
 And come down. [0:22:26]
 And we're looking for the degree. [0:22:29]
 And we can load this degree to which is the lowest it will go. [0:22:34]
 And that will conform to that edge. [0:22:37]
 So we've got that curvature in there. [0:22:40]
 Let's click on that surface and see that in a bit more detail. [0:22:43]
 I'll come out of the view. [0:22:45]
 And deviation, which is under the object style. [0:22:49]
 And that's about halfway down. [0:22:52]
 That's set this to 0.01. [0:22:55]
 So we've got a cleaner surface there. [0:22:57]
 And you can see how that looks. [0:23:01]
 So we look at that surface. [0:23:03]
 How clean the output there is to compare to this one. [0:23:06]
 If we did the same with this one. [0:23:08]
 So this compound solid. [0:23:10]
 0.01. [0:23:13]
 Well, let's go 0.5. [0:23:17]
 Then we can see how clean that is. [0:23:21]
 When you output this out as well with this SDL will be a higher definition as well or whatever you've output it out to. [0:23:28]
 If you're not using the mesh work bench. [0:23:30]
 So just be aware this is taking more computer power as well. [0:23:35]
 Now we've got this. [0:23:36]
 I'm going to hide the sketches by clicking on the sketch line, [0:23:39]
 Pristened space part and also do the same for the sketch inside here as well. [0:23:44]
 So let's click on this sketch. [0:23:47]
 Hide that. [0:23:48]
 And that's quite a solid out of this side as well. [0:23:51]
 So just come over to the part work bench. [0:23:55]
 And we're going to create a rule surface. [0:23:58]
 Conquer it rule surface across here because one edge. [0:24:01]
 So we need to create a rule surface across these two arcs here. [0:24:07]
 So these two edges. [0:24:09]
 Troll click those two. [0:24:10]
 Create the rule surface. [0:24:13]
 Now we're going to be able to create rule surface across the top. [0:24:17]
 Like so, rule surface. [0:24:20]
 And you see that we've got some information in there. [0:24:23]
 So we can't do that. [0:24:24]
 We're going to need to use the surface work bench. [0:24:27]
 Doesn't really work between a line and an arc that connected. [0:24:33]
 So come over to the surface work bench. [0:24:38]
 And create a film surface. [0:24:41]
 Add edge. [0:24:42]
 So that the two edges. [0:24:45]
 The surface is in there. [0:24:46]
 Let's hit OK. [0:24:48]
 And now we can go for the same process over in the part work bench. [0:24:52]
 Of compounding these and making them a solid. [0:24:57]
 So control clip. [0:25:02]
 Or the faces that we want. [0:25:04]
 Should be all the surfaces. [0:25:08]
 Part compound. [0:25:11]
 Make compound. [0:25:12]
 And then finally click on that compound. [0:25:15]
 Part. [0:25:17]
 Convert the solid. [0:25:20]
 Remember to hide the compound. [0:25:23]
 And you now have the compound solid. [0:25:26]
 Word of warning. [0:25:27]
 These are non parametric. [0:25:29]
 So any amendments that are made. [0:25:31]
 They will be have to have the same process. [0:25:34]
 Done to the actual. [0:25:36]
 Bring about that compound. [0:25:38]
 Making that compound a solid again. [0:25:42]
 That's add the rest of this. [0:25:45]
 So that's bring back those sketches. [0:25:49]
 And it's basically a case of creating the final solid. [0:25:59]
 So it's in here. [0:26:00]
 So I'm going to hide these two. [0:26:07]
 And using over in the surface work bench. [0:26:13]
 Coming in. [0:26:15]
 And using the film tool. [0:26:18]
 As an edge. [0:26:22]
 I'm using the edges. [0:26:24]
 This one. [0:26:27]
 This one. [0:26:28]
 And this one. [0:26:30]
 Okay. [0:26:31]
 And that. [0:26:34]
 And we'll do the same on the other side. [0:26:37]
 Let's hide that one. [0:26:40]
 Again, this is symmetrical. [0:26:42]
 So we could have done it in symmetry. [0:26:44]
 Okay. [0:26:50]
 Let's bring back those surfaces back. [0:26:55]
 It's hide the sketches. [0:26:58]
 She's clicking the sketches. [0:27:01]
 This is space bar. [0:27:02]
 You can see those two in there. [0:27:05]
 And as come over to the part web edge. [0:27:08]
 And you can see it's the same process. [0:27:11]
 And I'm going to take these two. [0:27:15]
 Place a rule surface. [0:27:18]
 You can see we've got an art between those rule surfaces. [0:27:21]
 So I'm going to delete that. [0:27:23]
 Oh, that's underneath picked the sketch there. [0:27:26]
 So you can see the sketches being selected there. [0:27:28]
 I should slap that rule surface. [0:27:30]
 So make sure we slap that rule surface. [0:27:32]
 It's highlighted there. [0:27:33]
 Hit delete. [0:27:34]
 And let's take the top. [0:27:36]
 These two. [0:27:37]
 Trouquette those rule surface across that. [0:27:40]
 That's better. [0:27:41]
 And finally over in the surface in workbench. [0:27:46]
 We'll add with the finnintel. [0:27:50]
 Add edge. [0:27:55]
 And work her away around these edges. [0:28:00]
 Okay. That's around the other side. [0:28:04]
 And edge. [0:28:08]
 Okay, that. [0:28:16]
 Now the same process. [0:28:18]
 Over in the part web edge. [0:28:20]
 Click one face. [0:28:22]
 Control click all the rest. [0:28:24]
 We're going to way around. [0:28:27]
 Remember the ends. [0:28:29]
 Part compound. [0:28:35]
 Make compound. [0:28:37]
 And then finally click that compound. [0:28:39]
 Part. [0:28:41]
 Convert to solid. [0:28:43]
 Specially covered. [0:28:44]
 It's the solid. [0:28:45]
 Click on the compound process based by hiding it. [0:28:49]
 So that's bring back the other solids. [0:28:53]
 That will create it. [0:28:55]
 You can see those there. [0:28:57]
 We could take these. [0:28:59]
 And fusion those together. [0:29:01]
 So control clicked all of them. [0:29:03]
 Not to part compound. [0:29:07]
 Make compound. [0:29:08]
 And then click on that compound. [0:29:11]
 And click on the union. [0:29:15]
 That's created that as one fusion. [0:29:17]
 So when you compound them all together. [0:29:19]
 You can actually fusion those together. [0:29:21]
 So we've got the fusion. [0:29:23]
 And now we've got our finished. [0:29:26]
 Well, partly for the ship that we can add more to the ship shape. [0:29:31]
 Well, it's talking about with the part design process. [0:29:36]
 Come over to the part design and code to the model. [0:29:41]
 We can create a new body in here. [0:29:44]
 So create body. [0:29:46]
 And what we can do is take that fusion and drag it into that body. [0:29:51]
 It's created a base reference. [0:29:54]
 So that means we can use that base reference in there. [0:29:58]
 To create the rest of the geometry upon. [0:30:00]
 The trouble is is that we're using not the compounds. [0:30:04]
 But the fusion that's been made up of that compounded solid of those compounds. [0:30:15]
 So if we change these underlying sketches of these compounds, [0:30:20]
 it's not going to be parametric. [0:30:23]
 So you just have to be wary of that. [0:30:25]
 If you wanted to change the underlying shape of this. [0:30:29]
 Because now we can actually take the top of this and sketch upon here. [0:30:35]
 Then say a circle in the middle. [0:30:38]
 Like so. [0:30:40]
 It enclose. [0:30:42]
 And then we can pad that. [0:30:44]
 And you can see we can add extra geometry on top of here. [0:30:49]
 Using the part design workflow. [0:30:53]
 So for instance, we can come to the front and create a new sketch. [0:30:58]
 Long the accept plane and hit OK. [0:31:02]
 Section view. [0:31:05]
 And we can add what if we want in here. [0:31:08]
 For instance, the side since circles. [0:31:12]
 Make sure that equal. [0:31:21]
 Make sure they're in line. [0:31:23]
 Take in the center points. [0:31:24]
 Place them in line. [0:31:27]
 These are commos and I've been down. [0:31:31]
 I've also changed diameter. [0:31:34]
 In close. [0:31:35]
 And that's pocket that. [0:31:39]
 Going through all. [0:31:42]
 It's much quicker to plane. [0:31:45]
 And you can see how they've gone through that. [0:31:47]
 So you can see how this is solid. [0:31:50]
 It allows you to do this. [0:31:53]
 If we did this with the compound, what will end up with is the shell. [0:31:57]
 And we wouldn't be able to make a solid out of this. [0:32:03]
 So just have to be wary of that. [0:32:05]
 There are tools to make a parametric solid. [0:32:09]
 And those are in the curves workbench. [0:32:11]
 But we're going to curve workbench. [0:32:13]
 More in the future because that's more of a vast workbench to be using. [0:32:18]
 Remember that we can add further defyment in the part design workbench. [0:32:24]
 If we're not happy with this shape. [0:32:26]
 And we're going to do that in the same plane. [0:32:29]
 The X-Z plane. [0:32:30]
 Okay. [0:32:31]
 And it will be advisable to do this closer to the beginning of your project. [0:32:35]
 But this is just showing what you can do. [0:32:38]
 And I can create a sketch in here. [0:32:40]
 We use the section of you once again. [0:32:43]
 And that's say we can use the Beast plane. [0:32:47]
 And I want to create more depth. [0:32:53]
 I want to create more of a curvature here. [0:32:58]
 For instance something like this coming up. [0:33:01]
 And across. [0:33:03]
 And we're just adding that in there. [0:33:07]
 We've got something like that. [0:33:12]
 And we can make some refinements. [0:33:19]
 And we're pulling this out. [0:33:22]
 What I'm doing is just making a way to cut away some of this geometry in here. [0:33:30]
 Next thing I'm going to do is put a square around here. [0:33:34]
 Like so. [0:33:35]
 And close that. [0:33:36]
 Maybe it could be odd what I've done. [0:33:37]
 But when I hit the pocket. [0:33:42]
 And change this to through all. [0:33:45]
 And make it symmetrical to plane. [0:33:48]
 You can see we can start to take away some of the geometry underneath. [0:33:56]
 So we can refine our shape. [0:33:59]
 I said this will be best done closer to the beginning. [0:34:02]
 Because you're more ways to actually affect the underlying shape underneath. [0:34:09]
 And we're coming to that pocket. [0:34:11]
 And we'll click it. [0:34:13]
 Make sure we can see. [0:34:16]
 And pocket itself. [0:34:17]
 So we can see what we've done. [0:34:19]
 And just add a bit more of finding that. [0:34:23]
 So that's it. [0:34:32]
 That's how to use a skirt and with the surface workbench. [0:34:34]
 To create something like a simple ship. [0:34:37]
 Allow and you to take that and place it within. [0:34:40]
 You can see it's a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of a bit more of [0:35:10]
 a bit more of a bit less of tapping shortcuts back past his bullet hand ropes but I think he's just come past him straight away by that [0:35:15]
 maybe some of you in individuals taking a look at it now, quite funny how he done so takes the spanner longest step so it's worth it [0:35:22]
 your career as you can't say how many of you are putting in the point because it's just just that everything Uzama got worth this much what it seems, he got a quick look at it [0:35:35]
