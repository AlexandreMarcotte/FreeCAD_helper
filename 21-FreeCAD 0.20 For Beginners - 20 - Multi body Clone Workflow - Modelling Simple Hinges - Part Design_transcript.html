===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 20 - Multi body Clone Workflow - Modelling Simple Hinges - Part Design =====
 over one and we'll come back to the Lennie FreeCap for beginners, [0:00:02]
 while we're teaching the fundamentals of free CAD, [0:00:04]
 with practical examples whilst we'll learn workflows. [0:00:07]
 In this example, we're going to be using a part design clone workflow. [0:00:13]
 Now this allows me to create a template body [0:00:16]
 and then create clones from that template body [0:00:18]
 to add additional geometry on. [0:00:20]
 We're going to be taking you through these workflows [0:00:22]
 and some of the pitfalls that you may counter when using this workflow. [0:00:26]
 So I hope you enjoy these videos, [0:00:28]
 and let's have a look at this technique. [0:00:29]

 So for this workflow, we're going to be using the part design. [0:00:58]
 And we're going to be using the clone workflow, [0:01:02]
 so this icon here. [0:01:03]
 First of all, we need something to clone. [0:01:06]
 So this is going to be our base body that we're going to create. [0:01:10]
 Number of other bodies off of that are slightly different. [0:01:13]
 It's almost like a template. [0:01:15]
 So we're going to create a body and then create a sketch. [0:01:19]
 Now I'm going to create a simple hinge [0:01:22]
 and I'm going to start on the XZ plane. [0:01:26]
 And I'm going to create a circle. [0:01:30]
 I'm going to start with a circle. [0:01:32]
 I've got the old constraints on and we're going to constrain this to the center point here. [0:01:37]
 That's getting some dimensions in here. [0:01:41]
 So I'm going to set this dimension to 10 millimeters. [0:01:46]
 So I've got the first part. [0:01:49]
 Now I'm going to create a line that attaches to this circle. [0:01:51]
 So I'm going to create a line and attach that to the circle [0:01:55]
 and bring this out. [0:01:56]
 Make sure it's straight. [0:01:57]
 Now I've got that one there. [0:01:58]
 That's put some tangency. [0:01:59]
 We're taking this line and this circle. [0:02:02]
 I make those tangent to each other. [0:02:06]
 Yeah, okay. [0:02:08]
 So we've got this coming along here and curving up like so. [0:02:12]
 Now let's use the polyline. [0:02:15]
 I'm going to take this point to come up. [0:02:18]
 Connect up to horizontal line, come across and connect up to the circle. [0:02:25]
 So we've got that one there. [0:02:26]
 So it's great. [0:02:27]
 And I'll see I've missing some vertical constraint. [0:02:32]
 So we add that one in. [0:02:33]
 Place the length. [0:02:35]
 And we're going to go 30 millimeters on that one. [0:02:40]
 Now let's remove some geometry from here. [0:02:44]
 So I'm going to zoom in. [0:02:45]
 I'm going to use the trim edge. [0:02:48]
 Also available from sketch. [0:02:50]
 Sketch geometries. [0:02:52]
 I knew I'll find the trim edge there. [0:02:54]
 I'm going to trim away this edge in here. [0:02:58]
 We can see everything is constrained down and that's important. [0:03:03]
 Because sometimes trim edge is worth result in the quintestant constraint. [0:03:06]
 Being removed. [0:03:08]
 So if any of this is white, then you know it's for not fully constrained. [0:03:12]
 That's close that. [0:03:14]
 Now we've got our base sketch. [0:03:17]
 Let's come over to the model. [0:03:20]
 Make sure that sketch is selected. [0:03:22]
 And we're going to pad that. [0:03:23]
 Now I'm going to make it symmetrical to plain. [0:03:26]
 And I'm going to pad this forwards around about 40 millimeters. [0:03:32]
 So we've got the starts of our hinge here. [0:03:37]
 I'm now going to make a separation around about half white from this part [0:03:44]
 and remove this part. [0:03:47]
 But I'm leaving a space in here to allow the hinge to rotate. [0:03:50]
 So creating the blank first. [0:03:54]
 So first of all, we'll make a sketch on this face. [0:03:57]
 New sketch. [0:03:59]
 Now we don't need to reference this external geometry. [0:04:04]
 Because we've got this point in here. [0:04:05]
 So we've built this around this center point. [0:04:08]
 So when we rotate this, it's actually rotate around the right part as well. [0:04:12]
 So I'm going to create a circle. [0:04:15]
 And this is going to be pocket. [0:04:18]
 So we're going to pocket away some of this material. [0:04:20]
 So we've got that circle in there. [0:04:25]
 That's pulling some of this external geometry. [0:04:28]
 Because I'm actually going to use a measurement in here. [0:04:32]
 So I'm going to measure from this point to the circle. [0:04:36]
 So we're going to need a point on this circle. [0:04:38]
 So using this point, attach it to the circle. [0:04:42]
 And also I'm going to attach that point. [0:04:44]
 And I can use this line here or I can just bring this down actually. [0:04:49]
 And bring it down to this one. [0:04:51]
 So it's out of the way. [0:04:52]
 So take this point and this vertical line and place a point from line constraint. [0:04:59]
 Therefore I can take this point and this point and place a gap in there. [0:05:07]
 What about a millimeter? [0:05:08]
 So we've got that in there. [0:05:11]
 If I close that and pocket that, you can see that's time to take away material here. [0:05:21]
 So this will allow the other hinge to attach and have some space in here to that to rotate. [0:05:28]
 Now this is 40 millimeters I believe. [0:05:32]
 So that's set this to 20, so half of that. [0:05:36]
 So we've got that there. [0:05:38]
 We could hook this up with a function if we wanted to. [0:05:42]
 So we could go to this pad as you can see. [0:05:47]
 You'd think 40 there and we can reference that rather than putting 20, [0:05:53]
 we could place pad and dot length and divide that by 2. [0:05:59]
 So you're 20. [0:06:00]
 So that's all ways there. [0:06:01]
 That's okay that. [0:06:03]
 So we've got our first part of our hinge. [0:06:08]
 You notice that the attachment will need basically a mile and a few miles in here. [0:06:15]
 So we're going to need a hole or a pocket that pockets all the way through here, [0:06:19]
 leaving some gap and then on the other one we're going to need a pad that comes out. [0:06:24]
 So they slot together. [0:06:25]
 This is where this workflow comes in handy. [0:06:29]
 Because we create a blank, we can take that body and one going to do is [0:06:35]
 rename that. [0:06:35]
 And we call this hinge template body. [0:06:41]
 When we click on that body, we get the clone tool available. [0:06:46]
 So Cracer clone or part design, grayer clone. [0:06:50]
 The clone has been created as a separate body here, which we can right click and transform. [0:06:57]
 I'm going to place this out the way here. [0:07:00]
 I'm now going to build upon this clone. [0:07:05]
 So the first thing I'm going to do is take this face and place the sketch upon it. [0:07:12]
 Now you can see it's asking me to make an independent copy, make a dependent copy, [0:07:17]
 the reason why, if I can't tell you that, you notice that the hinge template here [0:07:22]
 is highlighted in bold. [0:07:25]
 That means that's the active body. [0:07:27]
 To add a sketch to this body, we need to click on it and make the active. [0:07:33]
 So right click, toggle active body. [0:07:35]
 Double clicking also does this or if we double click this one, you can see that's bold and active. [0:07:41]
 Double click up body, then this one active. [0:07:44]
 Now we can click on that face and create a sketch. [0:07:49]
 When that face now, and I'm going to come in, [0:07:54]
 I'm going to create a circle on here and come out. [0:08:00]
 This is going to be the female section of the hinge. [0:08:04]
 Hit Escape, take that circle and set some diameter. [0:08:10]
 And that's set that to something like 7mm. [0:08:14]
 So go that one there and close that and now we can take that sketch [0:08:22]
 and pocket that into this section. [0:08:28]
 Now I can set this up with a formula again. I can go back to the original model [0:08:34]
 or we can just decide how deep we want to go with this pocket. [0:08:38]
 We know 20mm is the size of this. [0:08:44]
 So if we go around about 15mm and hit OK, [0:08:51]
 then we've got that hole in there with that pocket in there. [0:08:56]
 And we can use that 15mm against the pad of the other clone. [0:09:01]
 So we've got our first one in there, let's do our next one. [0:09:06]
 So taking this body again, this clone, make sure you pick the body and not the pocket [0:09:12]
 because you can actually clone at different parts. [0:09:16]
 That does come in handy. [0:09:18]
 If you want to take your model as a template from different sections, [0:09:22]
 so you may want to take, say this, this may have a drilling pattern on top of here, [0:09:27]
 but you may want to take the original pad or the original pocket, this one, [0:09:32]
 which will be before the drilling pattern. [0:09:34]
 So for instance, I can take this part here, this one here and make a clone. [0:09:40]
 And you'll see this clone's been created. [0:09:44]
 If I right click and transform that out the way, [0:09:49]
 you can see we've got a clone of that pad, that one there. [0:09:56]
 I don't want that so I can get rid of that. [0:10:00]
 You know, make sure that pocket has been shown. [0:10:05]
 I'm going to take this hinge and again clone it. [0:10:09]
 We now got the second body. [0:10:14]
 Let's right click, transform and come out. [0:10:18]
 Well, this is the second clone. [0:10:21]
 You can see the rotation we got on there is rotation around that center point. [0:10:26]
 And that's bring this out. [0:10:28]
 That's okay, that's. [0:10:32]
 And now what we do is take this face once again. [0:10:38]
 New sketch, remember to make sure it's active so it comes to the last body we've cloned. [0:10:44]
 Double click it. [0:10:45]
 That's now highlighted in bold. [0:10:48]
 Let that face, new sketch. [0:10:52]
 So we're sketching upon that face now. [0:10:56]
 And this time, that's place is circle in here. [0:10:59]
 Let's connect out to this center point. [0:11:01]
 Come out and we'll take that circle and set some dimensions. [0:11:08]
 We'll die and we'll start. [0:11:10]
 Let's go one minute or less so six millimeters. [0:11:12]
 So this will seven millimeters is six. [0:11:15]
 We'll close that and then we'll take the pad and pad this out to 15 mil. [0:11:24]
 So we've got that one in there. [0:11:29]
 If we want to do what we can do is actually come in and pocket all the way through here and make [0:11:37]
 this bigger coming out. [0:11:39]
 We've got that option. [0:11:41]
 Why I'm just going to leave it like that. [0:11:42]
 So now we've got the template and two clones. [0:11:46]
 And this is the female hinge. [0:11:51]
 This was a clone. [0:11:55]
 And then we've got the male. [0:11:59]
 So we've got those. [0:12:05]
 Now watch what happens if we change this clone. [0:12:09]
 So we're going to keep away from this part here. [0:12:12]
 And I'm going to add a drilling pan onto this face. [0:12:17]
 So click that face add a new sketch. [0:12:20]
 Remember that we've got to come back and double click on that body. [0:12:26]
 Now we can add the sketch. [0:12:28]
 So as flitters around and what we can do now is add the drilling [0:12:35]
 pattern. [0:12:36]
 So for instance, that's bringing some of the edges. [0:12:40]
 And bring the top line and the bottom line. [0:12:42]
 And create some circles in here, which I'm going to pocket through. [0:12:50]
 So I'm creating a number of circles. [0:12:52]
 I'm creating four and hitting escape. [0:12:57]
 Click on the top. [0:12:59]
 Make sure these two are in line. [0:13:02]
 And the same for the other two. [0:13:06]
 This one and this one. [0:13:08]
 And make sure we've got vertical constraints against this one. [0:13:17]
 And this one and the same between this one. [0:13:20]
 And this one. [0:13:22]
 So I've clicked that first because I had four to do. [0:13:24]
 So there's four clicks. [0:13:26]
 I'll actually get these in line. [0:13:28]
 Then we'll align now so we can create some distance between these two. [0:13:33]
 So five and we'll go five from here as well. [0:13:40]
 And the same for this one. [0:13:46]
 Let's put this point. [0:13:48]
 So five millimeters and finally this one and this one. [0:13:56]
 Five mil. [0:13:58]
 And we'll take all these and put a radius on the here. [0:14:04]
 So let's let them in the mall and then add in the radius. [0:14:08]
 Now I'll make them all equal. [0:14:11]
 And we'll set the radius for millimeters. [0:14:13]
 So we've got a sketch at the moment. [0:14:17]
 Now watch what happens when I pocket that sketch. [0:14:19]
 It will apply it to all the others. [0:14:22]
 Let's go for all. [0:14:24]
 And here, okay. [0:14:27]
 So now I did that to all those. [0:14:31]
 So we added a drilling pan. [0:14:32]
 Now a word of warning about topological name in issues is that [0:14:37]
 that's how we take this face and I've felt it to here. [0:14:41]
 You can see what's happened. [0:14:43]
 We've got some problems because we've affected the number of [0:14:49]
 faces on here. [0:14:51]
 We've actually added to here. [0:14:52]
 Then we've got problems with all the pockets and [0:14:57]
 the pads. [0:14:59]
 They've been attached to what was that original face but it's now moved. [0:15:04]
 Because we've added faces and edges into the mix. [0:15:08]
 So we just have to be aware of that. [0:15:11]
 Let's cancel that. [0:15:12]
 Because I added a sketch upon here and crated, say another circle in here, [0:15:20]
 that's not going to affect the face makeup on where I've placed [0:15:27]
 a sketch. [0:15:28]
 So if I place a hole through that, we can see we're okay. [0:15:32]
 So we just have to be very careful of where we place that. [0:15:36]
 But for quick simple parts such as this, then this workflow is quite handy because [0:15:42]
 this quick is to the point and you can get your work done quite quickly. [0:15:46]
 So I hope you enjoyed that workflow. [0:15:49]
 Maybe useful for small parts that you want to create and you just want something like a very [0:15:54]
 simple blank, they're going to use multiple times to create your models. [0:15:59]
