===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 21 - - Spreadsheet Configuration Tables - Dimensions from a Dropdown =====
 Hi viewers, welcome to the channel and today we're looking at configuration tables. [0:00:03]
 And if you don't know what configuration tables are, they allow you to use a spreadsheet [0:00:07]
 with a number of values in here. So we've got the A, B, and C here. And add that to a drop down. [0:00:14]
 Allow me to assign each of the values, just by changing that drop down. [0:00:22]
 We're going to be learning how to do this and also how to retrofit this to a existing spreadsheet model. [0:00:30]
 So for instance, I have this parametric brick here. If I come over to the part, I can change the brick [0:00:36]
 configuration in the different brick sizes to a 2 by 3 or a 2 by 2. [0:00:44]
 And add more sizes in there to allow us to not go back to that spreadsheet and keep [0:00:52]
 update in the values. Through this tutorial, you'll learn how powerful the configuration table is. [0:00:57]
 And we'll give it covering both part and part design objects. [0:01:01]
 Basically, you can see from the next demonstration where we show brick fit into another spreadsheet [0:01:06]
 that can be used in any of the work benches. So I hope you enjoy these videos and that's [0:01:11]
 have a look at this technique. If you like, we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a [0:01:17]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:01:38]
 So the first thing I'm going to do in free CAD is create a new document. [0:01:42]
 I'm going to come over to the part and we're going to start with creating a standard cube [0:01:49]
 just to demonstrate the configuration table. And then come over to the spreadsheet and I'm going [0:01:55]
 to define some values in the spreadsheet for the cube which has this box dimensions on the data tab [0:02:02]
 of length width and height. At the moment we can see they're all 10. [0:02:06]
 So I'm going to set this to say 30 by 30 by 30. And the reason being is I want to show you that [0:02:15]
 this is changing when we add spreadsheet. There we've got a cube here. When the spreadsheet [0:02:22]
 workbench and we're creating new spreadsheet. Now it's important when we start to leave this column [0:02:27]
 blank because this is going to take the labels for the different configurations that we're going to add. [0:02:32]
 First of all we need a default configuration to tell the spreadsheet we're using the configuration table. [0:02:37]
 To do that I'm going to start adding some headers along here. Now this is nothing to do with [0:02:44]
 the configuration. This is just to do with identifying those fields. So we're going to go for a [0:02:51]
 height, width and length. Just keeping it simple for the time being. And then we're going to show you [0:02:58]
 how to retrofit this to a spreadsheet that you may already have. So we've got higher width and length [0:03:04]
 there. And I'm going to add some values of 10 by 10 by 10. And then from here we're going to add [0:03:15]
 alias to these fields. So each of these fields is going to be either stop. So this one's going to be the [0:03:21]
 height. Now case does matter here. So I'm using the upcase h for height. And the same for the width. [0:03:30]
 Now if this was lowcase this will end up being a separate alias. I'm hitting enter on the [0:03:37]
 alias fields. And what you'll see is that this will show up as yellow to show that alias has been taken. [0:03:42]
 And a length in this one. Now this is important. So if here ends now, for instance the arrow keys [0:03:49]
 to move around because what we've got is our default values that run across the top. I haven't added [0:03:55]
 anything to this field yet. Let's come back to the cube and look at the length. We're going to hook [0:04:02]
 this up to our spreadsheet. So click on the length field. That's bring this out a bit and then we can [0:04:07]
 see what actually happens in here. So look at the length we're using this little icon on the end, [0:04:13]
 which will open up the formula register at the moment it's got the value in there. So if I [0:04:18]
 start to type spreadsheet you see the spreadsheet appears here, click on that. And then the [0:04:24]
 dot is added and we can use the length to bring in that value. See the values bought in as 10. [0:04:30]
 Let's do the same for the next one, the width. And the spreadsheet. Now use the down arrow key to [0:04:39]
 let that and start typing width using down arrow key. Enter and okay. And we'll move down. [0:04:48]
 And this one spreadsheet down arrow and finally height. And here enter. So those all connected up [0:05:03]
 and you see we've got our cube now, which is 10 by 10 by 10 and you can see by clicking on that [0:05:10]
 cube we get those individuals, formulas that have been added in from the spreadsheet. So now let's go [0:05:17]
 back to the spreadsheet. What we want to do with this is add a number of different sizes going down here. [0:05:26]
 So these will be different configurations. So we've got our base size here which is 10 by 10 by 10. [0:05:32]
 This is going to be our defaults. So we're going to create a 1 by 1 by 1, which is a [0:05:40]
 jubcut of the top here, which is 10 by 10 by 10. And for the time being we're just creating [0:05:48]
 another one which is 1 by 1 by 2, which is a 10 by 10 by 20. So what we've done is basically taking [0:06:04]
 this and jubcut it up for our first row and then changing it for our second row. That's important [0:06:10]
 because when we add the configuration table by clicking on this space here between our row labels [0:06:17]
 and our default values. And right clicking we get this drop down appear and we go to configuration [0:06:25]
 table. We can then configure the table. It's going to ask for a property in a group. Now if we look [0:06:31]
 over to the left hand side we can see the spreadsheet is highlighted and we've got property and [0:06:37]
 these gray areas are the groups. So I'm going to add a property of say configurations. This can be [0:06:46]
 whatever you want. So there are configurations and the group also can be whatever we want. So [0:06:52]
 I'm going to add it to something called parameters. Now before I hit OK look over to the left hand [0:06:58]
 side. So you'd spreadsheets there. We've only got that basin label property there. That's it OK. [0:07:04]
 We now got configurations added and you can see that here we've got the 1 times 1 by 1. [0:07:14]
 That's been jubculated up. Now if I change the configuration to 1 by 1 by 2 and click off [0:07:23]
 you notice the top 1 has changed to 1 by 1 by 2. So this is the concept that did one also the default [0:07:30]
 one when we very first coming and if we change that again we got the 1 by 1 and you'll see that's [0:07:38]
 changed there. If I click on these you notice that the area is still height but the content has changed [0:07:43]
 so it's equal dot B3, equal dot C3, equal dot D3. That's tile this window. [0:07:51]
 See it tile and we get these side by side. So we got the spreadsheet and document and if I change this [0:08:00]
 configuration and observe what's happening now I got click off and we'll see the 1 by 1 by 2's been [0:08:08]
 taken and you can see that there and our spreadsheet has changed. Goofing about this if we want to add [0:08:15]
 more values we just add them to the end of the spreadsheet so I'm going to go for 1 by 2 by 2 [0:08:22]
 which is a 10 by 20 and then by 20 I'll just hit the tab key to go to the next column [0:08:34]
 and now when we click on the configuration drop this down we got this 1 by 2 by 2. Click off [0:08:42]
 and our configuration is word. Now it's been added to the spreadsheet we can add this to the cube. [0:08:49]
 The thing that we have to be wary of in a part workflow that we're using here [0:08:55]
 come back to the part workflow is that we have the cube when we add something like another cube to [0:09:04]
 this like so and I'm just going to transform this and say bring this up here. [0:09:11]
 Hit OK so we've got two items here I want to add this drop down to this cube but I can't really [0:09:19]
 because I've taped these two cubes and do anything like boolines or cuts on there or a union [0:09:25]
 let's go for a union on those two we get a fusion so if I added this drop down which is on the [0:09:34]
 spreadsheet to that cube it's going to be nested inside here so we have to open this nesting up [0:09:40]
 how do we get around this? We're on every single workbench if you look to the top [0:09:46]
 you'll see a toolbar which has a yellow stare so this crate part this might be in a different [0:09:53]
 position and we can pull this out and put this somewhere else I'm just going to pop it here for now [0:09:58]
 so this yellow stare here which is crate part I'm just going to close the spreadsheet [0:10:04]
 and maximize my screen like so now if I click that part anything new I add now will be added to the [0:10:15]
 so there's a cube that's added so it's been added to that part there let's delete that [0:10:20]
 and pull in the fusion into the part you can have multiple parts so if I add another part here [0:10:29]
 this becomes the active part you see it embold if I add a cube now it gets added to the active part [0:10:36]
 if I wanted to add a cube to the other part this one here I have to right click and come up to [0:10:43]
 toggle active part so that's active now if I had a cube now it gets added to that part [0:10:51]
 I'm just going to delete that part will happen if I hit the delete key on the keyboard [0:10:56]
 it will say the part is not empty you're going to delete the contents as well which I'm going to say [0:11:00]
 yes to and I'm going to delete the cube from that part as well and also delete the fusion [0:11:06]
 and finally the last cube inside here the one without the formula of parameters added to [0:11:13]
 delete that so I've got a cube inside the part now how do we move this configuration [0:11:20]
 to this part so this will never change the contents will so this is a perfect place to place [0:11:28]
 the configuration it's quite simple come back to the spreadsheet and we click on the same [0:11:35]
 field that we did before click on it you can see content equals hidden breath so this tells you [0:11:41]
 that this is connected to a configuration table if I right click on that and go to configuration table [0:11:49]
 that brings me back to that same configuration table that I'll edit in from here I can actually [0:11:54]
 remove it by the onset but we don't want to do that all we need to do if we look we've got this group [0:12:01]
 parameters that's changed this property that's just typing up case p a rt for part you can see the [0:12:10]
 part is showing there it's put a full stop we're adding there and hit okay now the configuration here [0:12:20]
 is still sitting here have come on to the model and drop this configuration down what you'll see [0:12:28]
 it's not taking a fat on this model if I go to over to the part you will notice that we got [0:12:37]
 parameters now and configurations and we can drop this down to what every one click off and now that's [0:12:45]
 on the part taking a fat on our model so anything we do in here now that's had a sphere and say [0:12:53]
 take the cube and control click this sphere and do a cut so cut out that section there [0:13:01]
 apart we'll still have the configuration on there because that never changes but our cube has [0:13:08]
 so you can see that cut is sitting there so I changed that part now to a configuration of [0:13:16]
 one by two by two and click off you can see that's taking the fat and our cut is still sitting there [0:13:23]
 included into that model so what I've done now is enter the part design workflow we're going to show [0:13:29]
 you the same process but there's one difference in that we don't use the crate part because we have [0:13:37]
 a body this is where we add that feature upon there so that drop down can be added to that body so [0:13:45]
 create a body and then create a new sketch we're going to do the same go along the xy plane [0:13:51]
 I'm going to create a model in there off that cube so we're going to use the center [0:13:57]
 rectangle and use the old constraints with that checked and we hover over that center to make [0:14:04]
 quins and constraint and we come out therefore with this we can add some length again it's our [0:14:10]
 spreadsheet here so this one will be spreadsheet dot length same process just that we're using the [0:14:20]
 sketch and this one is spreadsheet dot width so coming to the former editor spreadsheet dot width [0:14:28]
 and then what we're doing after this once we got the width and the length in there the height [0:14:36]
 if we close this make sure that sketch is selected and use the pad this is where we add the height [0:14:45]
 so this former again is the length we come in here and do spreadsheet dot height [0:14:51]
 and okay that okay once more we've got the formulas in on the pad for the length this one is [0:15:04]
 spreadsheet dot height and then we got the length and the width in the sketch if we come down [0:15:09]
 to the constraints and open this up you notice we got the length and the width in here for the two [0:15:16]
 constraints are in there that's all rigged up now now we just need to add the spreadsheet [0:15:23]
 to that body I previously cleared out the configuration table otherwise we're going to get an [0:15:30]
 error on here so we come into here right click and configuration table and we just hit the unset [0:15:37]
 to clear that out now when we add this instead of putting part we just use body you can see [0:15:43]
 body has come up body dot and I can change it to config this time just to show that we can use [0:15:52]
 different labels in there and we'll do config dot prams instead that's okay that so that's in there [0:16:01]
 if we look at the body we got this config here and we can drop this down and now change this to [0:16:07]
 whatever we want so straight away that's working so that's how to add it to your part design [0:16:15]
 workflow pretty simple very similar so what I'm going to do now is retrofit this spreadsheet and this [0:16:22]
 model to configuration table that's first have a look at what this is so if I use the spreadsheet I [0:16:30]
 can control the width and the length which controls the configuration of this brick so we've got [0:16:38]
 as you can see the configuration on the bottom we've got one tube there if I change that spreadsheet [0:16:43]
 to say width of three and a length of five it will automatically update and I'm going to [0:16:53]
 set the tubes in here the minimum here is a two by two I can't go any smaller than that [0:16:58]
 because any smaller and then we actually get rid of this tube I'm going to come out to the spreadsheet [0:17:08]
 and starting adding the configurations in here so two by two a two by three and we're going [0:17:15]
 for a three by three so this is going to be the configuration table and we'll just pad this out with the [0:17:22]
 values but we need the A this and this is where the problem starts to occur so two by two [0:17:30]
 I can put the column headers in here and I'm going to fill out a wheel so this one is going to be [0:17:38]
 either width and this one is going to be length that's take the width first so this one here it's [0:17:46]
 come out to the width this one so width units we can see that this one here has a dependency on this [0:17:55]
 width units so that's take this field which got to in it width units and right click and cut so [0:18:04]
 moving that field and I'm going to place it in to this one right click paste so that one is [0:18:12]
 width units it's been moved so this field now it's got no use it's just sitting there that's [0:18:20]
 note the value in width here and let's move down to keep that in view and change this width so this should [0:18:30]
 update let's change this to four click off nothing's happened the link has somehow got severed [0:18:39]
 between this I this and the calculator fields how do we fix that well the easiest way to do it is to [0:18:50]
 click on the I this and change it and that's how just a one on the end of that I this if we hit end [0:18:56]
 now see the width has changed it's actually updated it's got a new alias so it's updated the alias is [0:19:04]
 still linked but that update has fixed the problem there if we come out to the spreadsheet we're [0:19:12]
 going to have a bit of an average and I have a little bit of what happens let's change that alias back [0:19:19]
 now let's change this back to width units and hit enter and click off so this now is width units [0:19:29]
 if I change this back now everything should calculate correctly so you just have to be wary of that [0:19:36]
 when you're changing this over to a configuration table that's take the link few minutes now [0:19:43]
 do the same take the link few minutes right click cut click on the link right click paste that's in [0:19:51]
 there now we look at the top we can see the refresh of the sheet well it's not even showing as a [0:19:57]
 refresh so the everything looks okay it's quickly changed that to one and to click off click back on [0:20:05]
 left units is one let's take that off that should have fixed the alias in problem [0:20:10]
 so if I change that now to free this link for change and we can see it does and we come out [0:20:18]
 to the parent break do my free and let's change that back to two for the link [0:20:23]
 and it's changing absolutely fine so let's put the configuration table in here use the first [0:20:32]
 config but we got problem in that our fuse compound could change so I could add another shape [0:20:40]
 or another geometry on here and that workflow will be updated causing the active object the [0:20:46]
 topmost object change so that's add a part this it's a lattice workbench workflow this one here [0:20:55]
 now we're looking there we can see it's no part designed so let's just add a part in here [0:21:04]
 using the part drag the fuse compound into the part and now we're ready to sign up a drop down [0:21:12]
 in the part come back to the spreadsheet i'm going to select our first option which [0:21:19]
 is going to be the default and the currently selected right click configuration table [0:21:25]
 property is going to be the part and it's coming up here dot and we're called as brick sizes [0:21:32]
 next thing is going to be the group and we're called as primes [0:21:39]
 here enter let's be added now let's come over to the brick and we'll see that's changed [0:21:49]
 so our current one is two by three let's have a look going to the part and come down we got our [0:21:56]
 configurations in here two by three and a three by three there we go that's working because we added [0:22:04]
 that's the very first one then that's being removed so we need a two by two in here so that's [0:22:11]
 added two by two let's try it in 31 so right click insert one row above and two by two you can see we [0:22:21]
 got some rec compute fails down here and that's add two by two in here and we can see that's taken [0:22:29]
 everything looks okay edit there's no refresh let's come back to our brick [0:22:38]
 click on the part two by three now we should have a two by two look off that's working [0:22:45]
 and finally we got the three by three and that's working so now if we come back we can get rid of [0:22:53]
 these fields so the width units and the length units if you wanted to what you can do [0:23:01]
 is bind these two this value here so we get an update between them so if I bind this length [0:23:10]
 units by right click bind it's going to ask us what cell we want to bind it to so we bind in cell [0:23:18]
 B1 the first element range the cell to be two which not what I want to do I want it to [0:23:24]
 be 12 so let's come down and change this to be 12 and change this one to be 12 and here okay [0:23:34]
 we've now got a bind itself let's do the other one so right click bind and we want this to [0:23:45]
 C12 so C12 let's keep it up a case just in case and C12 and okay [0:23:54]
 those are bound now so we could have removed them but I've just kept those there so they update [0:24:03]
 click on the part and change this to two by two come back to the spreadsheet you can see the two by two [0:24:10]
 has been added there got two by two here and our brick has changed so we've kept these fills in [0:24:22]
 and we've got our configuration table down the bottom which we can add to if we want to which [0:24:28]
 the add one in there and everything's working fine so that's how to retrofit a spreadsheet with [0:24:34]
 the configuration table and also binding in the cells if you want to keep them so I hope you enjoy [0:24:39]
