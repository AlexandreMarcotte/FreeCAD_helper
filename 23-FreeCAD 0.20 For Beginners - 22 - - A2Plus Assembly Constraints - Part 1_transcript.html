===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 22 - - A2Plus Assembly Constraints - Part 1 =====
 I will come back to another episode as a learning freak out for beginners, we will teach [0:00:04]
 the fundamentals of freak out whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:07]
 In today's lesson we can be using the A2+, and learn about some of the hidden constraints. [0:00:11]
 We will also be sharing some tips when using the A2+, to help you with your workflow. [0:00:18]
 We can be concentrating on the point on point constraint or the point identity constraint, [0:00:24]
 the point on mine constraint, the point on playing constraint, and also we will be spending [0:00:29]
 a little bit of time with the axis, quinciting constraint. [0:00:33]
 We can be building and learning how to apply the constraints to this assembly, and also [0:00:37]
 with a simple runner assembly with a ball within a slot like this. [0:00:43]
 This will simulate a ball running up and down this slot, where we can't move it out the slot [0:00:48]
 in any of the directions as set for back and forth. [0:00:51]
 I hope you enjoy these tutorials and let's have a look at this workbench. [0:00:55]

 Things I wanted to explain about in this workbench are the constraints that appear at the [0:01:25]
 top here. [0:01:26]
 If we roll over, you can see we've got the individual constraints and a quick description [0:01:31]
 of what they actually do. [0:01:33]
 We're going to explain those further. [0:01:35]
 First of all, we're going to explain the point to point constraint and also the point [0:01:40]
 on line constraint. [0:01:42]
 For that, I need something to constrain against, so I'm going to start in the document. [0:01:47]
 I'm going to use the part design. [0:01:48]
 You can use the part if you want, and we'll create a body and create a new sketch. [0:01:54]
 I'm going to go along the x-wipling and here I can. [0:01:59]
 I'm not too worried about dimensions, so I'm going to create a circle and a new circle. [0:02:06]
 I'm going to set the diameter of the circle to 50 and the outer one to 75. [0:02:18]
 One going to create is some kind of structure here to take rods that span across a body. [0:02:24]
 This will be something like you'll get in and where you're playing or something like that. [0:02:29]
 I'm going to come over to the pad or the pad at the top. [0:02:32]
 I've already got this selected and just pad this. [0:02:35]
 I'm going to set about 3mm in here and to the top. [0:02:39]
 I'm going to create a slot in here and I'm going to use a rectangle in here. [0:02:49]
 I'm going to set the dimensions and go for a height 10mm. [0:02:57]
 I'm going to also length on the sides again of 10mm. [0:03:04]
 I'm going to set some distance away because what we're going to do is use this to create a polar ray. [0:03:10]
 Use a length of 30mm. [0:03:15]
 To close, so we're created, basically the square on top of here, we can pocket that through. [0:03:21]
 We're going to go through all, or it's 3mm, so we just set this to 3mm. [0:03:27]
 That's gone all the way through then, here, okay. [0:03:30]
 I'm going to come over to the model and let that last pocket, which is the last actually [0:03:34]
 that we did, and use the polar pattern or cut to part design, apply a pattern, a polar [0:03:42]
 pattern. [0:03:43]
 I can see we're creating the pattern across here. [0:03:46]
 Now I only want to go 180 degrees, so I just don't want to do it on one side. [0:03:54]
 We set the current, it says to about 8. [0:03:57]
 We've got those there, and we can reverse the direction to place it on the other side. [0:04:02]
 Let's come up and hit, okay. [0:04:06]
 We've got this shape, so this spans 10mm, so we need to place something in here, so we can [0:04:12]
 constrain against. [0:04:14]
 I'm going to save this as a separate file, file, save as. [0:04:19]
 We'll create a new folder. [0:04:21]
 It's going to call it a 2 plus demo. [0:04:25]
 Now we've been that folder. [0:04:28]
 I'm just going to call this something like connector. [0:04:33]
 Next, I'm going to create the rods for that, I'm going to create a new document, and create [0:04:39]
 a new body, a new sketch, x, y plane, okay. [0:04:45]
 And we'll create a center rectangle. [0:04:48]
 You can create an all wrapped angle where I'm just going for a center one. [0:04:52]
 And I'm going to set these two sides to be equal, and also set a length of 10mm. [0:05:03]
 This is closed, and we're just astrubed that. [0:05:06]
 I could have used a part workbench to create just a cube and create the length for that [0:05:10]
 cube a bit longer. [0:05:11]
 I guess it's 200mm. [0:05:16]
 So we've got this rod here. [0:05:19]
 And file, save as our call this rod. [0:05:25]
 Now I've got the two parts that's come over to the A2 plus workbench. [0:05:31]
 For this assembly, I'm going to create a new document, it's a great new document. [0:05:36]
 And we're going to save it straight away in the same folder as the assembly. [0:05:46]
 But now I'm going to go to A2 plus, and I'd shape from a external file, not add a part [0:05:51]
 from a external file, I'd shape from a external file. [0:05:55]
 Bring in the connector first and select the body. [0:06:00]
 Import that. [0:06:01]
 So this is a fixed part, this is the first part we've imported. [0:06:05]
 And what A2 plus does is sets this as fixed part, you need a fixed part in the assembly. [0:06:13]
 Now we're going to import another one. [0:06:15]
 So A2 plus add shapes from a external file or we could use the toolbar, add shapes from [0:06:22]
 a external file and bring in the rod. [0:06:26]
 Bring in the body, make sure it's checked and import that. [0:06:31]
 So we've got this rod now. [0:06:34]
 Let's attach the mouse pointer and I'll just drop it into place. [0:06:38]
 So if I've got this connector, this body here, and I wanted to connect this one to it. [0:06:44]
 You've got a number options. [0:06:47]
 We're going to first look at the add point identity constraint or point to point constraint. [0:06:53]
 With this you've got to select a vertex of circle or a sphere and then select the same way [0:06:58]
 you want to connect it to. [0:07:00]
 So for instance, if I select this vertex here and come in and select the vertex just in this [0:07:07]
 corner, this will make it slots into that slot. [0:07:12]
 Let's place some angle going to here. [0:07:13]
 You can see how far away this is and we'll pick, let's say this one to let that vertex. [0:07:21]
 Must make sure you hit control so make sure you control that both of those. [0:07:25]
 You're seeing the blue on the left hand side. [0:07:28]
 The constraints that are available for your selection become active. [0:07:33]
 So you see the points on point constraint there and we just click that and set. [0:07:39]
 And I can see we haven't got that totally into that corner there. [0:07:43]
 Now the thing of point on point constraint is that it connects the vertex's. [0:07:50]
 But you have a lot of rotation here if you think about it as say two circle magnets connecting [0:07:55]
 together. [0:07:56]
 So vertex of vertex anything attached to those magnets can move in all different directions. [0:08:04]
 If I use the move to select a part under constraint, then nothing will happen with this. [0:08:10]
 I'm trying to move this and I've clicked on it and moved and you can see nothing's happening. [0:08:15]
 That's because you do them with rotation here. [0:08:17]
 So if this body transforms, it will snap back. [0:08:21]
 I'll show you that. [0:08:22]
 So I'm using the moving selected part not the move of selected part under constraint. [0:08:26]
 If I right click transform it's the same. [0:08:29]
 Now if I move this so it's the right and hit OK and then hit the ruby excuse. [0:08:36]
 So I've constraint it will snap back. [0:08:39]
 So when you select the move selected part under constraint and try to do that, we're trying [0:08:44]
 to do a transform and that's not allowed. [0:08:47]
 It will be allowed with other constraints or when you have another item that's connected to [0:08:52]
 this. [0:08:53]
 So this is the reason why some constraints you just put one object down connected to another [0:08:58]
 object and you can move it with this tool here and some constraints you can't. [0:09:05]
 It's all to do with moving something that can be rotated over something that can be transformed. [0:09:11]
 If the movement that you're using here is a transformation movement, then this won't [0:09:16]
 move. [0:09:17]
 If it's a rotational movement, which you can do via the move selected part under constraint [0:09:23]
 or if something was attached to this, then that's fine. [0:09:30]
 So if I resolve that now using the ruby excuse you can see that point is still on there. [0:09:36]
 But we've got all these degrees of freedom. [0:09:40]
 To lock this down even more we can take the other point that sits here. [0:09:46]
 Come around and control click the point here. [0:09:51]
 So you've got those two selected and I have a point on point constraint and I set that. [0:09:59]
 Now we've locked down the rotation even more but it can still rotate this way. [0:10:06]
 So you can see how that's been placed there. [0:10:10]
 Remember we're thinking about the vertexes as two small spheres that are connected together [0:10:17]
 and they have that freedom of rotation. [0:10:20]
 Now that's there, well we want this actually laying across here. [0:10:25]
 So what do we do? [0:10:27]
 We're just thinking about the African strengths. [0:10:29]
 I could take this line and control click this line and look at the constraints that come [0:10:36]
 up. [0:10:37]
 On point constraint that's great out but we do have something called the ad axis [0:10:43]
 coincident constraint and that lines the axis is of these two lines. [0:10:48]
 Now if you think of the axis going across this line this is where the axis is going across [0:10:54]
 here and the axis for this line is going across here. [0:10:57]
 So if you think about axis like in an axle going through wheels then you've got a line going [0:11:03]
 this way and line going this way and when you click on this it aligns and it's line those [0:11:11]
 in place. [0:11:12]
 We only need one because we got the two points. [0:11:17]
 Might be around the wrong way but we just use flip direction and that's placed it in the [0:11:22]
 correct place. [0:11:23]
 We'll set that and we can see that's there. [0:11:28]
 So any rotation on this using rotatool or the right click transform. [0:11:36]
 So that's rotate this upwards and okay. [0:11:42]
 If I use the Rubits cube to solve the constraint you just flip it back. [0:11:48]
 One going to do now is add another one of these. [0:11:51]
 Now we can do that via come out to the A2 plus and add shape and file and select in the [0:11:56]
 same shape again or better still let's click on that shape you can see it highlights [0:12:01]
 on the left hand side and we'll duplicate it A2 plus great jubcut of a part. [0:12:09]
 It gets attached to the pointer and we can place that wherever we want so I've placed [0:12:14]
 it there. [0:12:15]
 One going to do now is attach this rod to this part, this connection and we're going to [0:12:23]
 use a different constraint. [0:12:25]
 We could use the axis constraint or we could use the next one in our toolbar called the [0:12:32]
 point online constraint. [0:12:34]
 This is pretty simple. [0:12:36]
 We take a point or a vertex, click that and that's make sure we get the right one so we've [0:12:42]
 got one two so it's in here. [0:12:45]
 So I'm going to select the B for all, just like that vertex for the other one and we're [0:12:52]
 going to select this line, control select the line so the both selected you can see [0:12:57]
 in there. [0:12:58]
 We've got the point on the line constraint, the same one that's available and we click [0:13:01]
 that and the set. [0:13:05]
 So that's been placed in there but we've still got rotation if you think about this, [0:13:10]
 we've placed a point on the line which means this can be rotated, we've just got that [0:13:18]
 sitting on that line so if I click on that body and what we're doing is just right click [0:13:24]
 transform. [0:13:26]
 For instance that's rotate this, this way and okay and self-constant, it's just placed [0:13:36]
 that vertex back on that line. [0:13:39]
 We're not aligned to this rod, which is used to point on like this constraint. [0:13:45]
 We've also got rotation this way as well, I'm just going to control that so it comes [0:13:50]
 back and you'll see that we have rotation, if I click on it and use the rotate tool, let's [0:13:58]
 go for this one, this time from the toolbar. [0:14:02]
 We're going to transform rotate and we'll rotate this around. [0:14:06]
 Say like this and okay and solve, you can see that's been rotated around and we've got [0:14:20]
 a gap in there, just trying to get it so you can see the gap in in there so you can see [0:14:25]
 that gap in in there. [0:14:27]
 So how do we solve this? [0:14:29]
 Well we can take the other side at this point and use the other line, control click those [0:14:37]
 and point on line constraint. [0:14:41]
 That's the line that up there. [0:14:43]
 But remember we've only done one point. [0:14:47]
 So now we've got rotation this way because the point is on the line here, this vertex and [0:14:54]
 the other vertex is on that line. [0:14:56]
 So there's nothing to stop it tilting this way because it will just pivot around those two [0:15:01]
 vertices and to prove that we click it, use the transform tool, we'll rotate this way [0:15:12]
 okay solve and you can see that snap back but it's at an angle. [0:15:22]
 Now we could go in and say add the other two points, say this point or this point we only [0:15:31]
 actually need one because if we think about at one point against this line, should mean that [0:15:40]
 it can't tilt now. [0:15:41]
 We don't need the other point. [0:15:45]
 So if we rotate this, just click on it and use the Move tool and that's rotate. [0:15:53]
 So like that, okay and resolve you can see it's just snap back. [0:15:59]
 Now think about point and line. [0:16:01]
 We've got a point and line which is our multiple points in this line. [0:16:05]
 Then if we move this this way, that's valid because those points, those vertices [0:16:14]
 are still on that line. [0:16:18]
 If it's solved, it's fine. [0:16:20]
 What we should do to be able to do is use the tool, move slightly part under constraint. [0:16:27]
 Click on this one and you can see we can move it up and down, long that line and we can [0:16:35]
 move it off the edge because it's still on that line and though it's gone off the edge [0:16:41]
 it's still on that. [0:16:42]
 There's nothing to stop it. [0:16:44]
 We can't actually simulate that in A2 plus and you'll find you can't simulate that. [0:16:50]
 In some of the commercial packages as well, there's no physics or mechanics in the program [0:16:56]
 to stop that. [0:16:57]
 It's still good because we can just move that where everyone plays it in there. [0:17:05]
 So what I've done is just to close that document now and I'll create a new document and [0:17:10]
 we're going to look at the other constraints with these two. [0:17:14]
 First of all, we need geometry. [0:17:16]
 That's used the part workbench. [0:17:18]
 And though we can save it to a file for quickness, I'm going to keep inside the part workbench [0:17:23]
 in one file. [0:17:24]
 We're going to convert those to A2 plus parts. [0:17:27]
 So first, that's great, the sphere that we need and the spheres of radius of 5mm, so [0:17:36]
 it's 10mm wide. [0:17:39]
 And next, we're going to create something else, so that's come over to Sketcher. [0:17:44]
 Use Sketch, XY plane and we need something for the sphere to sit into. [0:17:52]
 Let's come over to the model and hire that sphere. [0:17:55]
 No one's going to do it is use the polyline and create something like this. [0:18:06]
 So I'm just creating a channel for this sphere to sit it. [0:18:15]
 Like so, just create that and I need a vertical constraint on there. [0:18:21]
 I've got some redundant constraints to come into task, clearly redundant constraints [0:18:25]
 and hit the lead. [0:18:28]
 Make sure that this one is 10mm wide. [0:18:32]
 So we've got that there that's put some more constraints in so keep those in line. [0:18:41]
 So we don't have to worry about symmetry because this is just four demonstration. [0:18:46]
 So I'm just going to use that for the time being. [0:18:48]
 I'm going to come over to the part workbench, make sure that Sketcher is selected and [0:18:53]
 a screwed that 250mm. [0:18:58]
 So we have this part and we have the sphere I've sitting there, which is transform this [0:19:05]
 out the way. [0:19:08]
 So we've got those too. [0:19:11]
 Let's come over to 80 plus. [0:19:15]
 Now because we haven't actually great those in separate files, we don't have to import [0:19:20]
 the men, but we do have to convert them. [0:19:22]
 That allows all the constraints to work and what will happen if we click on the sphere [0:19:27]
 use darker from the toolbar or 80 plus, convert a part to 80 plus part. [0:19:34]
 That's converted that to the part now. [0:19:37]
 And you'll notice that the sphere has become invisible. [0:19:40]
 If we want to change anything with the sphere, we use the invisible object. [0:19:45]
 This one here becomes great in. [0:19:49]
 And we can change the radius, etc. [0:19:51]
 So I can add 10 in here. [0:19:54]
 And you notice nothing's changed, but there's a refresh icon here. [0:19:59]
 I'd date parts, imported into the assembly or 80 plus. [0:20:04]
 I'd date parts. [0:20:07]
 And here, yes, that will update that part. [0:20:10]
 Let's change that back. [0:20:12]
 Let's sphere. [0:20:13]
 Let's come down to 5mm here, enter. [0:20:17]
 Every fresh, there we go. [0:20:19]
 That's refresh now. [0:20:21]
 So we need to do the same with this droot. [0:20:24]
 convert that to an 80 plus part. [0:20:27]
 So we have our two parts. [0:20:29]
 We have the sphere and the runner. [0:20:31]
 My aim is to take the sphere and run it up and down this runner. [0:20:36]
 Now to do that, if I take the sphere and control select, so this edge, that's not going to [0:20:44]
 work with a point in line constraint. [0:20:47]
 It's just going to take the sphere and place it through the center there. [0:20:53]
 And any rotation, let's just click on that and come into the sphere and right click [0:20:58]
 transform. [0:21:00]
 Now you rotate this and move it up. [0:21:04]
 OK. [0:21:06]
 And resolve, you can see it's still going for the middle of the sphere. [0:21:10]
 So we've got to find another type of constraint. [0:21:13]
 Let's click on back constraint hit the lead and we're back to where we was before. [0:21:20]
 This time, let's take this point and control select this line and use the point on line [0:21:29]
 constraint and a set that. [0:21:32]
 So we're embedded into the side of that. [0:21:35]
 This remember one was talking about the point or the vertex has been like a magnet, a [0:21:41]
 circle magnet. [0:21:43]
 It can rotate around this point. [0:21:46]
 So if I hit transform and rotate this, that just rotates the top line there, round and [0:21:57]
 OK. [0:22:00]
 And then use the solve. [0:22:03]
 You can see that's placed it in line with that one there. [0:22:09]
 And if I move up and down, it's still on that line and can move outwards, but we'll just [0:22:20]
 rotate it up. [0:22:22]
 So how do I get it attached? [0:22:25]
 So it simulates rolling up and down. [0:22:28]
 Well I can take the other point on this side. [0:22:33]
 Remember the radius of this is 10 millimeters. [0:22:37]
 So I'll take that point and select this line and use the point on line constraint. [0:22:44]
 I set that. [0:22:47]
 Then we've got that ball inside there. [0:22:50]
 This allows me to move this up and down using the move tool and that moves that up and [0:22:56]
 down, long there. [0:23:00]
 But you can see it's embedded into the bottom. [0:23:04]
 Can we get a better constraint? [0:23:06]
 Yes we can. [0:23:07]
 So that's highlight these two constraints and delete them. [0:23:10]
 You'll delete them from this strud as well. [0:23:13]
 And we'll move this out of the way. [0:23:16]
 Use the move tool or right click transform. [0:23:22]
 So how do we get a better constraint? [0:23:24]
 Well let's take the face. [0:23:28]
 Once we want it to roll against this face and select the ball, what does it feel? [0:23:36]
 Control set this here. [0:23:38]
 At the moment you can see this now options come up. [0:23:41]
 Let's click off and do that again. [0:23:44]
 That's better. [0:23:47]
 And we've got these options here, but we've got this one. [0:23:52]
 A point on plane constraint. [0:23:55]
 So let's select Vertex, center of circle or sphere and then a plane on another part. [0:24:03]
 Let's click that and see what happens. [0:24:06]
 Comes up with a offset which is going to be our friend in the moment. [0:24:11]
 The center of the circle, if we look, is in line with that plane. [0:24:17]
 So we place the plane from here upwards. [0:24:20]
 You can see that's in line. [0:24:23]
 What we need to do is use the offset and move that away from that point. [0:24:28]
 So we can place it minus five millimeters. [0:24:31]
 That places it away from that plane. [0:24:36]
 So the plane is there and that's set that. [0:24:39]
 If I move that with the move of the set to part under constraint, click on that part, [0:24:44]
 you can see what's happening. [0:24:45]
 It's moving across there. [0:24:47]
 Let's stop it from going through this model here, this object. [0:24:54]
 I'm going to select in the sphere and this time, I'm going to select this face. [0:24:59]
 I'm going to select that. [0:25:00]
 So we're adding two constraints and using the point on plane constraint. [0:25:05]
 Again, we need to use the offset. [0:25:08]
 So that's place the offset of minus five. [0:25:14]
 I'll set that. [0:25:15]
 Remember, we've got 10 millimeter ball. [0:25:17]
 So minus five is the radius rather than the diameter. [0:25:22]
 Well, five millimeters is the radius rather than the diameter. [0:25:24]
 And now that sets in that channel. [0:25:27]
 If I use the tool to move the selected part of constraint, [0:25:32]
 just let that. [0:25:34]
 We move up and down that channel. [0:25:36]
 That's the load it's rolling inside there. [0:25:39]
 So if the time being, I'm just going to leave you with those free constraints. [0:25:44]
 And then in another video, we'll move on to the other constraints. [0:25:48]
 And understand how those work with a simple demonstration. [0:25:51]
 I hope you enjoyed that video. [0:25:53]
 And I hope to see you again soon. [0:25:55]
