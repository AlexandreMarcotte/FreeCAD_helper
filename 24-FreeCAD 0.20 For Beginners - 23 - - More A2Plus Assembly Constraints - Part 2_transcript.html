===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 23 - - More A2Plus Assembly Constraints - Part 2 =====
 I've used more because the channel and we'll come to another episode of Learning Free Cat for beginners [0:00:04]
 will show the fundamentals of free cat from a beginner perspective. [0:00:08]
 We're concentrating on the A2 plus we're up into the moment and we're looking at the constraints. [0:00:12]
 We're going to be making a symbol assembly like this with a number of constraints in there going over the circular constraints. [0:00:20]
 So we're going to be using the Swiss Centre Ident constraint, the circular edge constraint, the axis constraint. [0:00:28]
 These allow us to, let's say, a circle when another circle in place, there's a top of your tower and therefore rotation, [0:00:34]
 rather than translation or transformation. [0:00:38]
 Circles sphere constraint, we can create rudimentary ball joints and the axis constraints key edges in line with the axis of that edge or even circle in line, etc. [0:00:50]
 We're going to be making this very simple construction, which allows me to actually move [0:00:56]
 this arm across this flywheel and see the ball joints moving. [0:01:02]
 So that's a look at this project in the A2 plus workbench. [0:01:06]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:01:32]
 So I'm in the part workbench and I'm going to create a sphere in here, and also I'm going to create a cube. [0:01:40]
 And we'll give that a bit more length width and height, say 12 across all three. [0:01:50]
 And we transform this sphere, right click transform. [0:01:54]
 And we'll place it somewhere in the middle, but I just want the top of the sphere just just an out from the top. [0:02:02]
 Something like that. [0:02:06]
 So okay that, I want to keep the cube and remove the sphere from inside. [0:02:12]
 So come over to the part, come down to Boolean and come down to cut. [0:02:18]
 So I've created this hollow in here. [0:02:20]
 This thing I'm going to do is create another set. [0:02:24]
 And we'll transform that right click transform. [0:02:28]
 I'm going over the side. [0:02:30]
 Okay, and I'm going to also remove the top of this sphere. [0:02:36]
 There's a reason for this. [0:02:38]
 I'm going to create another cube and just add another Boolean right click transform. [0:02:42]
 And I'm just going to cut that top of that sphere. [0:02:46]
 So what we're left with. [0:02:48]
 Once the transform is up, is that the sphere will have a small slice taking out the top. [0:02:58]
 Okay, all right let's see. [0:03:04]
 Control click cube. [0:03:06]
 Let's see it then cube. [0:03:08]
 And we'll move that sphere over a bit more. [0:03:10]
 That's right click transform. [0:03:12]
 Let's run about the middle. [0:03:16]
 And we go, okay that's. [0:03:18]
 We want to keep the sphere. [0:03:20]
 Control click the cube and we'll use the cut from the toolbar this time. [0:03:26]
 So we got the circle hollow and the circle on top. [0:03:32]
 That's come over to the A2 plus workbench. [0:03:36]
 And look at the constraints that we need. [0:03:38]
 So to constrain this sphere inside this hollow. [0:03:42]
 If I click on the sphere and control click inside the hollow, [0:03:46]
 we'll see the constraints that come up. [0:03:48]
 So we've got this sphere center identity constraint. [0:03:52]
 So this is places a sphere on sphere constraint. [0:03:54]
 Now before I do any of this, we first got to make this one fixed. [0:04:00]
 So this needs to be in a fixed position. [0:04:02]
 Otherwise we won't be able to make that constraint. [0:04:04]
 If I try to control click over those and create that sphere constraint, [0:04:08]
 it's going to complain about one not being fixed. [0:04:12]
 Okay that and delete it. [0:04:14]
 And hit yes. [0:04:16]
 So let's convert these to A2 plus parts. [0:04:18]
 So we'll click on part and we can use the convert part. [0:04:22]
 A2 plus and the tool part. [0:04:24]
 Or we can click on one of the parts and come up to A2 plus. [0:04:28]
 And convert a part to A2 plus part. [0:04:30]
 Now the converted we'll take one sphere, control click the other. [0:04:34]
 I haven't set this as a fixed position yet. [0:04:36]
 We'll just constrain that. [0:04:38]
 Okay the constraint and a set. [0:04:42]
 And what we'll do is then click on this one. [0:04:44]
 Come down to fixed position. [0:04:46]
 So we're taking the one that we want to make fixed. [0:04:50]
 Once it's got false, I'll set this to true. [0:04:54]
 And click off and come over to solve the constraint. [0:04:58]
 So the Rubits cube here. [0:05:00]
 Or A2 plus. [0:05:02]
 Solve constraint. [0:05:04]
 We've now constrain that sphere inside this box. [0:05:06]
 Vythe sphere within here. [0:05:08]
 I can't move this. [0:05:10]
 If I click on the move, that's part of the constraint. [0:05:12]
 Remember this is a move from last video. [0:05:14]
 If I try to move this you can see it's slightly moving in there. [0:05:18]
 But it's not doing anything. [0:05:20]
 And the reason is if I transform this. [0:05:24]
 I click transform. [0:05:26]
 This is what this move tool is doing. [0:05:30]
 We need enough constraint in here. [0:05:32]
 Because this needs to rotate inside here. [0:05:36]
 Full constraint to work. [0:05:37]
 At the moment this is locked in here. [0:05:39]
 We haven't got any dynamic movement in there. [0:05:42]
 I'm going to come over to the cylinder. [0:05:44]
 In the part. [0:05:46]
 Just add a cylinder in here. [0:05:48]
 And this takes us nicely. [0:05:50]
 Back over on the A2 plus workbench to the circle and circle. [0:05:54]
 The African strain I want to talk about. [0:05:56]
 Convert the cylinder to a A2 plus part. [0:06:00]
 That means we've got all the properties that we need for change this as an A2 plus part. [0:06:06]
 Now go the cylinder in there. [0:06:08]
 Let's take the bottom circle and control click the top circle of that cut. [0:06:14]
 So that's where that's placed in there. [0:06:16]
 I use the circle on circle constraint. [0:06:18]
 That makes a quintin and constraint with that circle. [0:06:22]
 We've got some loss set as well. [0:06:24]
 If we need it. [0:06:25]
 Also we've got the flip direction so we can send it in different directions. [0:06:28]
 Now what's happened is that we have. [0:06:31]
 This circle constraint in line with this circle. [0:06:34]
 It can't move away from that circle. [0:06:38]
 It can rotate in place. [0:06:40]
 The thing is now if I move this. [0:06:42]
 Use the move slightly part under constraint. [0:06:46]
 We can move this left right back and forth. [0:06:50]
 At the moment because I've got it from the right view. [0:06:54]
 We can see we're just moving it left and right there. [0:06:56]
 If you look how I move it. [0:06:58]
 If I move the mouse point to this way. [0:07:00]
 You see how that's moving. [0:07:02]
 And it will stop at a certain position. [0:07:04]
 That's because I need to move it. [0:07:06]
 If I move it, I'll move it. [0:07:08]
 And it will stop at a certain position. [0:07:10]
 That's because I need to move start moving it down. [0:07:14]
 So we start moving it down this way you can see. [0:07:16]
 This is moving this part and the part underneath it. [0:07:20]
 This sphere is rotating. [0:07:24]
 So we're dealing with transformation, not rotation. [0:07:27]
 This is the reason why this can move. [0:07:30]
 If I move that with the plain move tool. [0:07:34]
 Move this over. [0:07:36]
 Okay that and hit Rubits cube. [0:07:40]
 It will just snap back the same as this one. [0:07:42]
 We tried to move the sphere out. [0:07:46]
 Okay. [0:07:48]
 And use the Rubits cube to solve the constraint. [0:07:50]
 It will just go back in. [0:07:52]
 So we're quoted a very simple ball joint here. [0:07:56]
 Remember that the solver doesn't allow for collision detection. [0:08:02]
 So just be aware of that. [0:08:04]
 It's a dynamic assembly, but we haven't got that kind of collision detection in there to stop it from passing out of this circle. [0:08:12]
 The certain things we can do to simulate it up to an extent. [0:08:16]
 But that requires additional constraints. [0:08:18]
 And the more constraints we have, I'll see the more process of power and tentative it is. [0:08:23]
 But this is enough for a basic ball joint. [0:08:25]
 So that's the sphere in sphere constraint. [0:08:28]
 Now the circle constraint. [0:08:30]
 Which we've added here. [0:08:33]
 That allows me to control this here because this circle won't move outside of this circle. [0:08:39]
 It's fixed to it. [0:08:41]
 The thing that will happen, it will allow for rotation as well. [0:08:46]
 So I'm going to break the constraint of this cut. [0:08:50]
 So this one here. [0:08:51]
 I'm going to set this to fixed position of force. [0:08:55]
 And come into this cut. [0:08:57]
 And we've got the sphere. [0:09:00]
 Quist and constraint. [0:09:01]
 Let's delete that. [0:09:03]
 And we'll delete the circle edge constraint as far as camera without. [0:09:07]
 So we've got no constraints in here. [0:09:09]
 And I'm just going to delete that cube. [0:09:12]
 Gerrit is that cube. [0:09:14]
 So at the moment, if I move set to part and constraint, we will separate these. [0:09:19]
 Hit the solve and nothing happens because we haven't got any constraints. [0:09:23]
 I'm going to fix position of this sphere now. [0:09:26]
 Fix position has true. [0:09:29]
 And we'll use the circle and circle constraint here to here. [0:09:34]
 And circle and circle. [0:09:37]
 Set that. [0:09:38]
 So these circles are now attached. [0:09:41]
 If I try to move this, then it won't move. [0:09:45]
 Because we're trying to transform the cylinder on a fixed position. [0:09:52]
 I'm going to take that same cylinder and make a jub book of it using the jub book tool. [0:09:57]
 Or a two plus great jub book part. [0:10:00]
 Well, that allows me to do is, what we'll do is click on that and just move that out of the way. [0:10:07]
 Let's move it over here. [0:10:08]
 It was actually still attached to the mouse pointer. [0:10:10]
 So that's okay. [0:10:11]
 And we use the bottom circle here. [0:10:15]
 Control click. [0:10:17]
 The top circle. [0:10:18]
 Use the circle and circle constraint and a set that. [0:10:23]
 So we've got two cylinders on top of each other. [0:10:26]
 If I try to move this now with move set to part and constraint, [0:10:30]
 then you can see we've got a very slight moving in there, [0:10:34]
 but it's not going to move because again, we're trying to transform this. [0:10:38]
 This is fixed. [0:10:40]
 This is constraint against the circle. [0:10:43]
 So it won't move outside this circle. [0:10:45]
 So transformation is not allowed. [0:10:47]
 If I bring this around, we can see that we have these two lines aligned at the moment. [0:10:54]
 But, click on this cylinder. [0:10:57]
 Right click transform. [0:11:00]
 I'm going to rotate this. [0:11:02]
 I'm going to rotate it this way. [0:11:04]
 You can see the line here is not in line. [0:11:08]
 Okay, that. [0:11:10]
 And hit the solve. [0:11:12]
 Nothing's happened. [0:11:14]
 So this has an allowance for movement around. [0:11:18]
 So this will watch the spin on here. [0:11:22]
 And we can prove that by coming over to the part for a bench. [0:11:27]
 And actually I'm going to come into the sketcher. [0:11:31]
 I'm going to create a sketch along the x-y plane, which is fine. [0:11:36]
 That's hide. [0:11:38]
 The cylinders. [0:11:40]
 So that's hide. [0:11:42]
 This one. [0:11:43]
 This one. [0:11:44]
 And this one. [0:11:45]
 And creates. [0:11:48]
 A slot. [0:11:52]
 And hit task. [0:11:53]
 We've got some redundant constraints. [0:11:54]
 So that's just delete that. [0:11:56]
 And we'll create a circle in here as well. [0:12:03]
 So we've got that there. [0:12:04]
 That's kind of the part and the screw that. [0:12:07]
 So basically this is going to be a handle. [0:12:10]
 And that's just through this by two millimeters. [0:12:13]
 Got the circle to do the constraints against. [0:12:17]
 Let's go to 80 plus and convert that to an 80 plus part. [0:12:21]
 Buckle them and then strewd. [0:12:23]
 I'm using the convert to a 2 plus part or a 2 plus. [0:12:27]
 Pervert part. [0:12:29]
 That's an 80 plus part now. [0:12:31]
 Let's bring back the other cylinder. [0:12:35]
 And this one. [0:12:38]
 And also we want the cut. [0:12:40]
 So we've got those there. [0:12:42]
 A moment this is in constraint. [0:12:45]
 So we're going to do is take the circle. [0:12:49]
 Troll click. [0:12:50]
 Sender circle. [0:12:51]
 So those are selected. [0:12:53]
 See those in green. [0:12:55]
 And use the circle and circle constraint. [0:12:57]
 So it's been moved up. [0:12:58]
 We've got this offset here as well to allow us to move it in different positions. [0:13:03]
 That's just a set that. [0:13:06]
 Now we can move this. [0:13:09]
 I'm going to use the move tool. [0:13:11]
 I'm not using the move selected by under constraint. [0:13:14]
 If I click on that, you see we can't transform it. [0:13:18]
 There's a bit of movement in there, but it's not enough to actually warrant any dynamics. [0:13:24]
 Let's click on this and use the plane move tool and rotate this. [0:13:31]
 So it's going to be the blue. [0:13:33]
 And we'll rotate this around to here and here. [0:13:38]
 Okay. [0:13:40]
 Sit the solve. [0:13:41]
 You can see that's rotated around. [0:13:43]
 But none of this has rotated. [0:13:46]
 So that's rotate this one here as well. [0:13:49]
 Rotate. [0:13:51]
 Rotate this around. [0:13:54]
 You can see nothing's really happening. [0:13:58]
 If I wanted to keep these together, [0:14:02]
 I need a different kind of constraint. [0:14:04]
 As well, this is a circle constraint that allows me to rotate around that circle. [0:14:08]
 We need to find some other kind of constraint. [0:14:11]
 So what happens if we take these two lines? [0:14:16]
 So this one here and this one here. [0:14:19]
 Controls let it both of those. [0:14:21]
 We've got a number of constraints that have appeared. [0:14:24]
 And we've got this add access, quinstant constraint. [0:14:28]
 That keeps the access of those two lines. [0:14:31]
 You think of the access for one's through here in line. [0:14:34]
 So we add that one. [0:14:36]
 Those are kept in line now. [0:14:39]
 So we've got the circle constraint against these. [0:14:42]
 But if I click one of these and use a rotate. [0:14:46]
 Rotate this around. [0:14:48]
 So here. [0:14:50]
 Okay. [0:14:51]
 We can see the lines aren't aligned now. [0:14:53]
 The access of those lines aren't aligned. [0:14:55]
 Hit the solve. [0:14:57]
 You'll see it flip that round. [0:15:00]
 Same with this one. [0:15:02]
 Okay that. [0:15:07]
 Use the solve. [0:15:08]
 And you'll see that's moved around. [0:15:12]
 So how do we get this constraint? [0:15:15]
 So if we change, say the rotation of this shaft, this moves as well. [0:15:22]
 Well, if we look at the hole, we've got line within here. [0:15:27]
 So if we change the diameter of this hole and close it up, [0:15:30]
 so it's the same diameter as the shaft itself. [0:15:33]
 And if we go in the cylinder and if we have a basic cylinder, [0:15:37]
 so that's what two millimeters, so it's a formula meter hole. [0:15:41]
 Come into this strewd, which is this one, the original strewd, [0:15:45]
 top of click of that sketch. [0:15:47]
 And that's set the diameter of this hole. [0:15:51]
 And what I need to do is just hide this strewd, so I can see what I'm doing. [0:15:55]
 So we've got that circle there. [0:15:57]
 I set the diameter of that. [0:16:00]
 No, it's 6.07, I set to 4. [0:16:04]
 So that's time that up against there. [0:16:06]
 That means if I close that, [0:16:09]
 bring back this strewd. [0:16:13]
 We can see nothing's taking effect yet. [0:16:16]
 That's refresh. [0:16:19]
 This is due on top of the only selected parts. [0:16:22]
 Go yes. [0:16:24]
 So the one that I selected, the only dark day that part, [0:16:27]
 and we see we've closed that hole. [0:16:30]
 I'm going to move this now. [0:16:32]
 Just move it up, away, up and out, so I can see inside. [0:16:38]
 And okay. [0:16:40]
 I can now take this line. [0:16:43]
 If we look inside because as a cylinder, there will be an edge. [0:16:46]
 Control click. [0:16:48]
 This line. [0:16:50]
 And use the access to the quintstant constraint. [0:16:54]
 And I set that. [0:16:56]
 So now we've got that constraint in there. [0:16:59]
 Everything's in line. [0:17:02]
 That means when I rotate this one. [0:17:05]
 Rotate this round. [0:17:09]
 The access is off for this. [0:17:12]
 Let's hit okay. [0:17:13]
 And hit solve. [0:17:15]
 You can see it flips back. [0:17:17]
 Let's rotate this shaft. [0:17:19]
 Let's get those all in line. [0:17:23]
 So if we rotate this shaft now. [0:17:26]
 Okay. [0:17:28]
 So we can see that's out of line. [0:17:31]
 Now when we hit the solve. [0:17:33]
 This one flips around. [0:17:35]
 And we can control other objects with those. [0:17:38]
 So when we have rotating handle, we can rotate something. [0:17:42]
 That pour something else. [0:17:44]
 That's try that. [0:17:45]
 So what I've done is created a new document. [0:17:47]
 I'm going to create a very, very simple assembly. [0:17:49]
 And here we're some moving dynamic parts. [0:17:52]
 Using the second strength, the circle constraint. [0:17:55]
 And the access quintstant constraint. [0:17:57]
 So growing new sketch. [0:17:59]
 X Y playing. [0:18:01]
 And the first one I'm going to do. [0:18:03]
 Here's basically going to be a will. [0:18:06]
 That will complice on our axle. [0:18:08]
 And it's going to have also a hole here. [0:18:14]
 So rotate around this circle here. [0:18:19]
 We're going to set to four millimeters. [0:18:22]
 And also something's going to be attached to here. [0:18:26]
 So I can drive something else. [0:18:29]
 And we'll set the outer circles well. [0:18:32]
 Set that to 45. [0:18:35]
 And we'll set this some distance away from here to here. [0:18:40]
 And 15. [0:18:43]
 So we've got that. [0:18:46]
 Let's go to the part and we'll just a screwed that by five millimeters. [0:18:54]
 So we've got our first part, which is the a screwed. [0:18:59]
 Let's hide that and create another part. [0:19:04]
 Gain news in the sketch app. We can use part design for this. [0:19:08]
 I'm going to keep it in the part for the time being X Y playing. [0:19:13]
 And I'm going to use a slot. [0:19:19]
 And we'll make that symmetrical to the center here. [0:19:22]
 Use the symmetry constraint. [0:19:24]
 Make sure this top line is long horizontal. [0:19:29]
 And we'll place two circles. [0:19:33]
 Each of these are going to be the same. [0:19:36]
 And each of these are going to be four millimeters. [0:19:41]
 So diameter or four millimeters just selected both of them. [0:19:46]
 And done that diameter in there. [0:19:49]
 Set some length. [0:19:52]
 And set this back 40 millimeters. [0:19:56]
 And we'll do some height as well. [0:19:59]
 Just to constrain it down. [0:20:01]
 Let's do diameter on there. [0:20:05]
 A little ten millimeters. [0:20:07]
 So we've got that there. [0:20:09]
 Let's close that. [0:20:10]
 And that's going to the part and a screwed that by free mill. [0:20:16]
 So we've got that one there. [0:20:17]
 So we've got two parts. [0:20:18]
 We've got the first a screwed and this will. [0:20:22]
 I'm also going to create a cylinder. [0:20:25]
 Now the cylinder needs to be four millimeters in diameter. [0:20:29]
 So we've got radius of two millimeters there, which is correct. [0:20:32]
 And this is going to be the actual that the wheel sits on. [0:20:37]
 So it's going to be fixed point. [0:20:40]
 That's come over to the A2 plus word bench and start construction in our assembly. [0:20:45]
 Versus take the cylinder and transform it somewhere. [0:20:49]
 Now we can use the move apart on the constraint. [0:20:52]
 And that will just pick it up and we can place it somewhere like so. [0:20:55]
 To make this fixed, I can't make this fixed at the moment. [0:20:58]
 Because it's not a native plus part. [0:21:00]
 That's a native plus operation. [0:21:02]
 So we convert to part or can't to 80 plus. [0:21:06]
 And convert a part to 80 plus part. [0:21:09]
 So that's the under there. [0:21:11]
 And we can see it's up there. [0:21:13]
 It's just moved. [0:21:15]
 So we can position this where we want. [0:21:19]
 And we'll fix that now. [0:21:22]
 So if we click on that cylinder, we can see we've got fixed position. [0:21:25]
 That's it. [0:21:26]
 That's true. [0:21:27]
 So we want always need to constraint again something that's fixed. [0:21:31]
 So this one's being fixed. [0:21:33]
 That's bring back the other strewd which is this wheel. [0:21:38]
 Click on this strewd. [0:21:39]
 I'm going to do the same convert to a me 2 plus bar. [0:21:42]
 I'm just going to use the toolbar. [0:21:45]
 And we're going to make our first constraint. [0:21:48]
 So the first constraint we're going to use. [0:21:51]
 It's going to strain this wheel against the fixed part. [0:21:54]
 And I'm going to use a circle on circle constraint. [0:21:56]
 If I click on the circle, control clicking on that top circle. [0:22:01]
 And we see the circle on circle constraint has appeared. [0:22:05]
 Click that. [0:22:06]
 And that's moved that into position. [0:22:10]
 Got some offset. [0:22:11]
 So I can offset it up or backwards. [0:22:15]
 I'm going to move it backwards and set that. [0:22:19]
 So at the moment, if we come over to the left hand side, [0:22:22]
 we can see we've got the cylinder inside here. [0:22:25]
 We've got a circle where it's constraint. [0:22:26]
 And inside this, we've got the same. [0:22:28]
 So these are matching constraints. [0:22:30]
 So if I try to move this now. [0:22:33]
 Using the standard move, move the selected part. [0:22:37]
 Which is right click transform. [0:22:39]
 Okay. [0:22:40]
 And then use the rubits cube. [0:22:42]
 This will snap back. [0:22:43]
 Place this back in a position. [0:22:46]
 Rotation is fine with this. [0:22:48]
 So I click on it and rotate. [0:22:50]
 Rotate this around. [0:22:52]
 Then that's absolutely fine. [0:22:54]
 I hit okay. [0:22:55]
 And if I hit resolve, you can see that's just rotated around there. [0:23:00]
 Keep it. [0:23:01]
 I on. [0:23:02]
 So this line here, that shows that hasn't rotated. [0:23:06]
 But because this whole here, you can see that's rotated around here. [0:23:10]
 So the disk itself has rotated around. [0:23:13]
 The axle's just kept static. [0:23:15]
 That's fixed position. [0:23:17]
 If I rotate that axle. [0:23:19]
 So the cylinder, right click transform. [0:23:22]
 Rotate this around. [0:23:24]
 So to here and hit okay. [0:23:27]
 The reason why it's rotated like this is because I transformed it [0:23:31]
 before I create a new new new plus part. [0:23:33]
 So the axis is off. [0:23:35]
 So resolve that now. [0:23:37]
 You can see this is moved over to where it is. [0:23:41]
 If I just come in to the part and create a cylinder here. [0:23:47]
 And then selected the cylinder over into a two plus. [0:23:52]
 And converted it to a two plus part. [0:23:56]
 Then if I right click transform, you can see. [0:24:00]
 Our center rotation is actually where it was originally. [0:24:04]
 Crited from. [0:24:06]
 Whereas this one. [0:24:09]
 Right click transform. [0:24:11]
 You can see. [0:24:12]
 Well, it's it's off because I moved it before I created. [0:24:15]
 That is a 92 plus part. [0:24:18]
 It's not to worry. [0:24:19]
 It's delete that one. [0:24:20]
 We're not going to be doing anything with the axle. [0:24:22]
 It's just going to be staying there. [0:24:25]
 Now I'm going to use the circle and circle constraint with these two. [0:24:29]
 It's taking the circle here. [0:24:31]
 Control click in this circle. [0:24:34]
 And using a circle on circle constraint. [0:24:37]
 I send there. [0:24:39]
 And we can use some offset to place it on top. [0:24:43]
 Like so. [0:24:47]
 And set that. [0:24:51]
 So now if I move apart to constraint. [0:24:54]
 We'll see that we can move. [0:24:57]
 This around. [0:24:59]
 No problems at all. [0:25:00]
 So we're actually moving. [0:25:02]
 This part here. [0:25:05]
 And you can see that the movement will move that well in. [0:25:10]
 And you can see that an edge. [0:25:12]
 See that edge. [0:25:13]
 That will. [0:25:14]
 It's being rotated around here. [0:25:20]
 So if this is rotating around like so. [0:25:25]
 We could add. [0:25:26]
 Say a ball joint onto this part here. [0:25:30]
 It's a create a quick ball joint. [0:25:33]
 Come over to the part. [0:25:35]
 And create. [0:25:37]
 Let's go for a cylinder. [0:25:39]
 And we're going to set the radius. [0:25:42]
 Front five. [0:25:43]
 So we've got that there. [0:25:46]
 Now we're going to take a zero away from in here. [0:25:49]
 That's create a zero. [0:25:54]
 Then I'm sitting there. [0:25:56]
 Click on the zero. [0:25:58]
 Right click. [0:25:59]
 Transform. [0:26:00]
 We're going to set the zero inside. [0:26:02]
 And also I'm going to set the zero. [0:26:06]
 And also I'm going to set the radius of it. [0:26:11]
 It's going to bring this down to free. [0:26:14]
 So it's inside there. [0:26:16]
 Do a bit more transformation. [0:26:19]
 And make sure it just comes out at the top. [0:26:22]
 Like so. [0:26:23]
 Okay that. [0:26:24]
 Click on the one that I want to keep, which is a cylinder. [0:26:27]
 And I want to make. [0:26:28]
 The sphere. [0:26:29]
 Remove the material from inside. [0:26:32]
 Using the cut from the toolbar or part. [0:26:36]
 Boolean and cut. [0:26:39]
 So now I'm going to come over to 80 plus. [0:26:45]
 And set this as 90 plus part. [0:26:49]
 So click on the cut. [0:26:51]
 And use the toolbar convert of part to 80 plus part. [0:26:54]
 Now you can see from over the left hand side that I've got this rogue. [0:26:59]
 Circle edge constraint here. [0:27:01]
 And this is the reason why you convert stuff to an 80 plus part. [0:27:06]
 Before you start adding constraints. [0:27:09]
 If we look down we got a strut object. [0:27:11]
 A strut zero zero one. [0:27:13]
 Which is this one. [0:27:15]
 Which I didn't convert to an 80 plus part. [0:27:18]
 So it's actually set the constraint outside. [0:27:21]
 It doesn't matter. [0:27:22]
 But if it's inside, we can see exactly what's constrained against it. [0:27:27]
 I'm just going to leave that for the time being. [0:27:30]
 We're going to line these circles. [0:27:32]
 So I'm going to take this circle. [0:27:35]
 And control click this circle. [0:27:38]
 Now we've got number options. [0:27:39]
 We can line it by the circle. [0:27:41]
 Which will allow that to rotate. [0:27:43]
 Or we can line by access. [0:27:45]
 Quinset and constraint. [0:27:47]
 If I use access. [0:27:49]
 Quinset and constraint. [0:27:50]
 You'll push it away from there. [0:27:53]
 Which I don't want. [0:27:54]
 So I'm just going to delete that. [0:27:56]
 I hit yes. [0:27:57]
 We want it circle and circle. [0:27:59]
 So I'm going to delete this circle. [0:28:01]
 And this circle. [0:28:02]
 And circle and circle constraint. [0:28:04]
 And set that. [0:28:05]
 So that's on there. [0:28:07]
 If we want to, we can take this line and control click this one. [0:28:16]
 And use the access quinset and constraint. [0:28:20]
 So the two accesses of those lines because the diameter of those two are the same. [0:28:25]
 That keeps those in lines. [0:28:27]
 So this one twist anymore. [0:28:29]
 That's in there. [0:28:31]
 So now we've got that. [0:28:33]
 We can create something here. [0:28:37]
 Now the idea that I'm thinking of is that if we move this under constraint, [0:28:44]
 then we can actually attach. [0:28:49]
 We'll constrain a ball joint. [0:28:53]
 And then have the other end to attach to something else. [0:28:56]
 So let's do that. [0:28:57]
 Let's create the actual ball joint for that. [0:28:59]
 And we can come back over to the part. [0:29:01]
 And create a circle. [0:29:03]
 So this circle is going to sit inside this one. [0:29:07]
 This will still sit inside here. [0:29:10]
 No matter what size it is because remember we're not constraining. [0:29:14]
 Size is just that object on or in another object. [0:29:18]
 We've got no concept of the boundaries of that in the dynamics of this program. [0:29:24]
 So I'll take that sphere and control click this sphere inside here. [0:29:28]
 And let's come over to the A2 plus. [0:29:30]
 And use the sphere on sphere constraint. [0:29:32]
 Then that's valid. [0:29:34]
 It's embedded in there. [0:29:36]
 But it's valid. [0:29:37]
 That's just a little bit of a problem. [0:29:39]
 And then we can create a circle. [0:29:41]
 It's embedded in there. [0:29:43]
 But it's valid. [0:29:44]
 Let's just delete that. [0:29:45]
 It's yes. [0:29:47]
 And what we're going to do is just convert this to an A2 plus part. [0:29:51]
 First of all let's move it out the way. [0:29:54]
 And I'm going to move it back to the origin. [0:29:57]
 So position zero and just zero those out. [0:30:03]
 And we'll convert that to an A2 plus part or A2 plus convert A2 plus part. [0:30:10]
 So we've got that sphere now. [0:30:12]
 So the sphere inside this cut here was taken from this object. [0:30:17]
 And we can click on that sphere and we can see the sphere itself was already a free millimeters. [0:30:22]
 So let's do the same for this one. [0:30:25]
 We've got two edits. [0:30:27]
 The original one because at the moment because this is an A2 plus part. [0:30:30]
 Then we have all the A2 plus options which don't include the radius. [0:30:34]
 We have to go back to the original sphere. [0:30:38]
 So hide the placement and come down to the radius and set that to free. [0:30:43]
 It's not going to take what we need to do is click that sphere and use the refresh or A2 plus. [0:30:51]
 Update part's important into the assembly. [0:30:55]
 I'm going to select one. [0:30:56]
 Then it's going to give me the option to update just that one or the whole lot. [0:31:00]
 I just want to update that one. [0:31:02]
 I think yes this will be now the right size. [0:31:05]
 But I want to update this to have a stem coming out the top. [0:31:12]
 So I'm going to get rid of that original sphere. [0:31:14]
 Just delete that and bring back the part. [0:31:18]
 Come over to the part. [0:31:21]
 And that's first. [0:31:24]
 Well I could remove something from here or I could create this as two parts of the assembly. [0:31:30]
 So a sphere with a top cut off and then a cylinder on top. [0:31:35]
 All I'm going to do is add a cylinder. [0:31:39]
 And we'll take that cylinder and set some radius of two. [0:31:45]
 Let's set this to one. [0:31:48]
 And we set some height as well. [0:31:51]
 It may change this. [0:31:52]
 So I've got 30 at the moment. [0:31:54]
 So that's Boolean needs to give us. [0:31:57]
 So take the sphere and the cylinder. [0:32:00]
 Part Boolean. [0:32:03]
 You need them those together. [0:32:05]
 Now I'm going to take that fusion over into the A2 plus. [0:32:08]
 We're bench and convert that to an A2 plus part. [0:32:11]
 convert to A2 plus part. [0:32:15]
 Make a constraint against the sphere and this internal sphere. [0:32:21]
 Sphere constraint and set that. [0:32:25]
 That's sitting inside that. [0:32:27]
 And what we'll do is just rotate this around the right way. [0:32:31]
 Do that. [0:32:32]
 Come to the fusion right click. [0:32:34]
 Transform. [0:32:36]
 And we'll rotate this around. [0:32:39]
 So it's around this way. [0:32:42]
 So it's okay. [0:32:45]
 So we've got that there. [0:32:50]
 If I simulate this with the move of heart and constraint. [0:32:56]
 We can see that's moving fine. [0:32:59]
 But you can see we've got animation problem detected. [0:33:02]
 And that's because I try to move that at an odd angle. [0:33:06]
 So I'm going to come around and just move it from this angle. [0:33:09]
 We're getting multiple parts under constraint now. [0:33:12]
 So we just have to be a bit careful and a bit gentle with the animation. [0:33:16]
 So we can see that's moving fine. [0:33:19]
 If I pull this right over here and try to get this an odd angle. [0:33:25]
 And that's not going to do it. [0:33:27]
 Sometimes it will rip this apart because we're trying to pull it against the constraint. [0:33:33]
 I'm going to link from this center a bit. [0:33:35]
 So coming to the fusion. [0:33:39]
 Well we need the original fusion. [0:33:41]
 This one here. [0:33:42]
 Click on the center. [0:33:44]
 And set this to 50. [0:33:46]
 Here enter. [0:33:48]
 Click on the fusion. [0:33:51]
 So this one here and hit refresh. [0:33:55]
 So it only updates us like to park. [0:33:57]
 I see it yes. [0:33:58]
 Sender is now lengthened. [0:34:01]
 And I'm going to use this cut and jukay that using jukay. [0:34:10]
 And it's attached to the mouse pointer. [0:34:16]
 And also I'm going to do the same with this one here. [0:34:19]
 So this fusion here. [0:34:20]
 We're going to jukay that as well. [0:34:22]
 So we've got two. [0:34:24]
 I would add the ball to the other end here. [0:34:27]
 But we're just going to do this quickly. [0:34:29]
 Now I'm going to take a circle on circle constraint between these two. [0:34:34]
 Circle on circle. [0:34:37]
 We need to flip the direction. [0:34:39]
 To go that one there. [0:34:41]
 Set that. [0:34:43]
 And then we can take. [0:34:47]
 This here. [0:34:50]
 And this here. [0:34:52]
 Control click those. [0:34:54]
 And use a sphonsphere constraint. [0:34:58]
 Set that. [0:34:59]
 And that's around the wrong way. [0:35:01]
 So that's click on this one and rotate it. [0:35:05]
 Using the transform. [0:35:08]
 And we rotate this around. [0:35:10]
 And when the solve is done. [0:35:12]
 It will just pop back into position. [0:35:15]
 So k that. [0:35:16]
 And solve. [0:35:18]
 So we got that there. [0:35:21]
 Now let's come around to the front and just straighten the sub of it. [0:35:25]
 And move this around. [0:35:27]
 Okay that. [0:35:28]
 And hit the solve. [0:35:30]
 So that's positioned properly now. [0:35:33]
 So now if I click on the ball joint and go to the properties and set the fixed position as true. [0:35:39]
 Then that can't move. [0:35:41]
 And we should be able to simulate the whole assembly together as one. [0:35:46]
 So we're going to start simulating the model now. [0:35:48]
 Now word of warning. [0:35:49]
 We have to be mindful of the actual limits of each of these pieces. [0:35:54]
 For instance, if I push this right over this way. [0:35:57]
 This is fixed. [0:35:59]
 So in a rule life assembly that will actually either fail or be ripped apart. [0:36:04]
 And the same is with the dynamic assembly. [0:36:07]
 So if I go to move apart under constraint and select the will and start moving this. [0:36:13]
 We have to go carefully. [0:36:15]
 Otherwise we'll end up pulling this apart. [0:36:18]
 So I've gone behind the limits of the constraint and things to start to fail. [0:36:22]
 I hit it controls it and back to where I was. [0:36:25]
 I find the best idea is to zoom in. [0:36:28]
 And then start moving. [0:36:30]
 Some of the assembly. [0:36:31]
 But just a little bit. [0:36:34]
 We get an idea of the limits of the actual constraint. [0:36:38]
 So I'm just moving around this will and I can see how the ball joints are moving. [0:36:43]
 If I go too far. [0:36:47]
 And sometimes it won't happen. [0:36:49]
 But if I make a sudden movement. [0:36:51]
 So you can see this is going too far. [0:36:53]
 This is starting to fail. [0:36:54]
 And it starts to fall apart. [0:36:57]
 Using controls add. [0:36:58]
 We're using the solve tool. [0:37:00]
 We'll resolve that constraint and pull it back into place. [0:37:03]
 So we can move different parts. [0:37:05]
 So I'm just going to move this part. [0:37:08]
 And you can see we've got to try with that part. [0:37:11]
 I've moved that part too far. [0:37:13]
 So this just gives you an idea of the movement and the constraints that you have and how they are working together. [0:37:19]
 So you can see those ball joints are working as we move this around this spiral. [0:37:27]
 Going forward we have the other constraints up here. [0:37:30]
 We've got access parallel, access plane parallel, etc. [0:37:34]
 etc. all along here. [0:37:35]
 And we've got a number of constraints for other types of assemblies. [0:37:39]
 But this gives you an idea from the last two videos how these constraints are put together. [0:37:45]
 And how they can be used together to create a full assembly. [0:37:49]
 And the future will be going over these as well. [0:37:52]
 And doing assemblies with those just show how those work. [0:37:56]
