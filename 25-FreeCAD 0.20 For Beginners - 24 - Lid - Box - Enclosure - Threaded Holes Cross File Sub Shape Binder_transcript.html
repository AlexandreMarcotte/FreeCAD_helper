===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 24 - Lid - Box - Enclosure - Threaded Holes Cross File Sub Shape Binder =====
 Hi everyone, I'm Alcantz the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning [0:00:04]
 Free Cat for Beginners, we'll teach the fundamentals of free cat from a beginner's [0:00:08]
 perspective. [0:00:09]
 Today we're going to be looking at a part design workflow across multiple files. [0:00:16]
 So a box like this with additional features within and this box contains a separate [0:00:22]
 lid as well. [0:00:23]
 You can see we've got Freddy, we've got these features to stop the box from misadmining [0:00:29]
 we were screwing the lid onto the box. [0:00:32]
 We've got the stem to hold the thread and on the bottom we've got the holes to allow [0:00:41]
 for the bolt to sink into the material and the thread to pass through the material. [0:00:48]
 We're going to be creating this across two files so we're going to use one file for the [0:00:53]
 box and one file for the lid and then we're going to finish by assembling them together. [0:01:02]
 We're going to be learning about Subchate Binders and also the whole subtractive feature [0:01:07]
 to allow us to add a hole we've thread into our models. [0:01:10]
 So I hope you enjoy this series and let's have a look at this workflow. [0:01:15]
 If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. [0:01:17]
 I also have a co-fire or a coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that's [0:01:22]
 at kouheifinfide.com, 4-M-A-N-G-0, also run a Patreon where you can subscribe and get extra [0:01:31]
 content and that's at www.picture.com, 4-slashmangojelly solutions. [0:01:36]
 So start if we're cad, I'm going to be using the part to time workflow. [0:01:39]
 It's going to come out to the part design. [0:01:41]
 We could use a part but the part to design automatically fuses pads and pockets together [0:01:47]
 making our workflow a lot quicker. [0:01:49]
 The first thing I'm going to do is create a body so we can create a body and then we [0:01:53]
 create a sketch. [0:01:55]
 You can start along the XY plane and okay so we've modelled the box from the top down. [0:02:02]
 I'm going to be using a rectangle but I'm going to be using the rounded rectangle. [0:02:08]
 This means that my box has rounded size automatically. [0:02:13]
 We could use a normal rectangle from here and then use the fillet tool to round those sides [0:02:20]
 off but we've got that tool there so we might use it because it's available. [0:02:23]
 Press the right mass button to get an asspoint at back and I'm going to take the inner [0:02:27]
 two points and place those symmetrical to the center using some of you can straighten [0:02:34]
 and now I've got to add some length and height in here. [0:02:38]
 So I'm going to take these two points and set a height of 50 millimeters and we're going [0:02:48]
 to take these two points here and set a length of 100 millimeters. [0:02:54]
 We also need to set the radius. [0:02:57]
 That's just pull these out to the left and to the top and the radius here. [0:03:04]
 I'm going to select the radius of this curve. [0:03:09]
 Then you can see they've got all equality constraints around there so set one more set [0:03:14]
 them all and we're constrained the radius and I'm just going to give that a radius of [0:03:21]
 10 millimeters. [0:03:24]
 So we've got our curved box as it close. [0:03:28]
 The next operation we need to do is make sure the sketch is selected and use the pad [0:03:35]
 operation and I'm going to pad this to 30 millimeters. [0:03:41]
 Here enter and we've got our pad. [0:03:45]
 Next thing I'm going to do is hollow out this pad by selecting the top. [0:03:49]
 Selected the top face with a single selection if I double click we selected the whole [0:03:53]
 body. [0:03:56]
 So just select the top. [0:03:58]
 Select it that face and we're going to come up to part design. [0:04:02]
 Play a dress up and I'm going to use the thickness option. [0:04:05]
 The thickness option is also available up here and the thickness option creates thickness [0:04:09]
 to those walls. [0:04:13]
 We're going to make the thickness inwards and we'll set the thickness to something like [0:04:18]
 3 millimeters. [0:04:19]
 You can see we've got the thickness there. [0:04:24]
 We've got mode types as well so we've got skin which I'm using at the moment we've [0:04:29]
 got a joint type of art or intersection with this one it's not going to matter because [0:04:35]
 we're just going to leave it on arc there. [0:04:38]
 If this was a straight box with straight size then we normally would change this to get [0:04:43]
 different effects. [0:04:45]
 I say okay and now we have part of our box. [0:04:49]
 I'm going to add the fixtures on here to allow the lid of the box to be screwed onto [0:04:54]
 this place. [0:04:56]
 So I'm going to select the face, we've in the thickness, I'm going to select the bottom [0:05:00]
 face there and we'll create sketch. [0:05:04]
 For now I'm going to create a number of circles but I'm going to import some geometry [0:05:10]
 and I'm going to import the outer geometry. [0:05:13]
 This curve here and the bottom one. [0:05:19]
 So we've got those two imported. [0:05:22]
 Come up to the circle and create a circle in here and one down the bottom. [0:05:29]
 So we've got those two circles there you can see them in there. [0:05:33]
 We'll set some diameter to both these circles by clicking them both and adding a straight [0:05:40]
 on the diameter. [0:05:42]
 You can set those to eight millimeters and close that. [0:05:47]
 So we only do one side because I'm going to mirror it over the other because this is symmetrical. [0:05:52]
 So I don't need to sketch those both into place. [0:05:56]
 Now I've got those in there. [0:05:57]
 I could use a symmetry against this with a mirror because if we have a symmetrical model [0:06:03]
 but for the amount on doing in here I might as well just come back in and import these curves [0:06:09]
 and just add to this sketch. [0:06:11]
 So I just get import the curves here and just do the same add since circles in here. [0:06:25]
 There's many ways of creating the box. [0:06:27]
 You could go for a full these symmetrical model by just going through the center but [0:06:31]
 it's decided to create it as one. [0:06:35]
 Press the right mouse button to get the mouse button back and I'm going to select both of [0:06:39]
 these and also select this one and make the me call. [0:06:45]
 Now I've got those in there that's close and we can pad these. [0:06:50]
 So we're going to hit the pad with the sketch selected and we want the pad them the [0:06:56]
 height of this box. [0:07:00]
 So we could use just placing the length in here but I'm going to use a formula and if [0:07:04]
 I type in pad which was our pad dot length this will give the length of our pad but [0:07:13]
 we also need to mine a soft thickness with dot and value that gives us 27 millimeters. [0:07:24]
 You can type in 27 millimeters in there if you want. [0:07:27]
 Hit OK and that's been added to there. [0:07:31]
 Now if we look back if I hit OK you can see what we've done we've used the pad dot length. [0:07:36]
 So this one here. [0:07:37]
 Press the space bar on that. [0:07:39]
 You can see we've got that box there and we've got a length of 10 millimeters. [0:07:43]
 Then we created the thickness which is a value of 3 millimeters. [0:07:49]
 So it has a 3 millimeter base here as well. [0:07:52]
 So we've got that one to just mine as the thickness of that pad and if I click on the last [0:07:57]
 one press the space bar and you've seen the green on the tip that's our last action. [0:08:01]
 I'm not going to add the holes to the shed. [0:08:06]
 Now the reason being is because I want to use those holes with a thread. [0:08:12]
 I'm going to be using the hole so the hole tool here and that will model the thread [0:08:17]
 but the thread takes a little while to model in there and also you're adding more faces. [0:08:21]
 So we're going to do that as our very last operation save on time and the topological [0:08:27]
 issues that may occur. [0:08:29]
 So we're going to save this body. [0:08:31]
 Say that's and I'm going to place it within a new folder. [0:08:37]
 So I'm just going to name this box demo within this folder. [0:08:43]
 I'm just going to name this box body. [0:08:48]
 So this is the first part of the box. [0:08:51]
 So if I wanted to create a lid in here what I would do is actually use part of this geometry [0:08:56]
 in shape binder. [0:08:57]
 I'll be using the substrate binder but I'm going to be doing something a little bit [0:09:01]
 difference with this one. [0:09:05]
 What you can do is keep it on the same file and create a binder in here by selecting [0:09:11]
 this face and the faces of these stems or stalks and create a binder and that we place [0:09:21]
 in the active body. [0:09:23]
 So at the moment we don't have an active body if I create a new body and say this will [0:09:28]
 be the lid. [0:09:29]
 Then I can't actually create a sketch in here x y plane and I'll okay that and pull [0:09:36]
 in this geometry for the actual lid because to save time I would want to pull in this [0:09:42]
 curve here and this curve here and just create the same rectangle against that for the [0:09:47]
 lid in a separate body and you can see that I can't roll over that it's saying the [0:09:51]
 object belongs to another body. [0:09:53]
 Can't link. [0:09:55]
 To allow me to link that to the allowed me to pull in that geometry I need to create a [0:10:00]
 substrate binder of this. [0:10:03]
 So if I create a substrate binder you see it's been placed into that body. [0:10:09]
 Therefore I can hide the original body leaving that substrate binder there and when I go [0:10:16]
 back into my sketch I can pull in these arcs so I can pull in opposite arcs and create [0:10:24]
 my rectangle against there to create the lid. [0:10:27]
 This is a well good but I want to keep some separation between the files so you may want [0:10:32]
 to keep the files separate one for the lid one for the body you may want to do in this [0:10:35]
 way. [0:10:36]
 I'm going to create the files separately so let's get rid of that body and it's content [0:10:41]
 so all we got in here is the pad and that's bring the body by pressing the spacebar. [0:10:50]
 So we've got the pad in there and this is the body that's create a new file and I'm going [0:10:56]
 to save it straight away so our file save as I can save into the same directory and call [0:11:02]
 this box lid. [0:11:03]
 So I've got the box lid in there I'm going to create a body so we've got the body of [0:11:12]
 that box lid ready to go. [0:11:14]
 The two files are open to you can see the tube timest down here. [0:11:18]
 Now this sequence matters the way you actually set these. [0:11:22]
 First go to the box body and one can select the faces that we want so I want to use [0:11:29]
 this face and I'm going to control the slits the faces off the stems or the stalks. [0:11:36]
 So we've got the low selected. [0:11:38]
 Now without clicking on anything else so it dislikes we need to keep those selected but [0:11:43]
 come down and select the tab of the lid. [0:11:48]
 Make sure you don't select anything so don't click anywhere in this space. [0:11:53]
 If we go back to that box body those are still selected so you can see those are still [0:11:58]
 selected there. [0:11:59]
 Let's go to the box lid and it's important that you use the tabs and not the [0:12:05]
 tree view for this operation. [0:12:08]
 With those still selected click on the substrate binder or part design create a subject [0:12:15]
 shape binder. [0:12:16]
 The binder is created in that new document and you can see the binder there and it's [0:12:21]
 been placed within that active body that body of that lid and if we go back to the [0:12:25]
 box body you can see what's happened. [0:12:29]
 Now if I come into the box body and say change the sketch underneath will serve what [0:12:35]
 happens in the box lid. [0:12:38]
 So for instance that double click on that sketch and change the 8mm diameter stalks or [0:12:44]
 the circles to say 2mm and close that. [0:12:50]
 When we come back to the box lid you can see we've got a tick there that means it needs [0:12:55]
 to refresh in, edit, refresh or use your shortcut key, mine's control R if you're [0:13:01]
 Windows it'd be something else and you can see after refreshing that's change. [0:13:06]
 So there's a link between these two files and I'm just going to change that sketch [0:13:11]
 constraint if I come down to the constraints we can change it from here as well and we're [0:13:15]
 going to set that to 6mm. [0:13:21]
 Back you can see the tick there, hit control off to refresh it, Windows it'd be something [0:13:28]
 else same with Mac and you can see that's been refreshed. [0:13:31]
 So we linked a shape binder across those files. [0:13:35]
 Now I can start modeling the lid and this is the more complex of the two. [0:13:39]
 That's create a new sketch in that body for that lid and place it along the xy plane and [0:13:45]
 okay. [0:13:46]
 The shape binder will be sitting above the sketch. [0:13:49]
 This is actually fine because I want to pull in some geometry and it will be projected [0:13:55]
 onto that sketch. [0:13:57]
 So you'll just use the geometry tool, external geometry tool and pull in this curve and [0:14:04]
 sit there and this curve. [0:14:07]
 Just going to pull those in for the starts and I'm going to use a rectangle box against [0:14:14]
 there. [0:14:16]
 This point we may want to use the section view or sketch, a few section. [0:14:22]
 So that clears our view away from the shape binder and we can start using something like [0:14:28]
 a rounded rectangle and place the rounded rectangle in here. [0:14:33]
 Hit a state to get a mouse point about right mouse button and these two points see if [0:14:38]
 pulled in opposite sides, point on point constraint or coincident constraint, those two [0:14:44]
 points coincident constraint and finally we're going to take this curve and this curve, the [0:14:54]
 one we imported and make those equal. [0:14:57]
 So let's equine their radius. [0:14:59]
 We get a fully constrained sketch. [0:15:02]
 So now we've got a sketch, that's close that and we're going to pad that by something [0:15:08]
 like three millimeters. [0:15:12]
 We're created our lid but we're not finished yet. [0:15:15]
 We're going to create another sketch upon here and create a sketch and I'm going to use [0:15:21]
 subject binder again. [0:15:23]
 But this time we're going to add the features that help this lid to stay in place. [0:15:29]
 So if I look from the top we've got the subject binder here and I'm going to pull in these [0:15:34]
 lines and these circles and create the features against this. [0:15:40]
 We're going to add about 0.5 millimeters away from here so we have a little feature that [0:15:45]
 keeps this lid in place. [0:15:48]
 So that's using pull geometry and I'm going to import this inner edge and this inner edge [0:15:55]
 and also the circles. [0:15:58]
 We're only going to do one side because we're going to be using mirroring and now I'm [0:16:02]
 going to use the section for you or sketch for you section so we get rid of that shape [0:16:07]
 binder. [0:16:08]
 So I'm going to use a rectangle so stand a rectangle and I'm going to place a rectangle [0:16:16]
 here and here and these are going to be padded but they're also going to set 0.5 millimeters [0:16:25]
 away from this point. [0:16:28]
 So this point and this point we're going to set a height of 0.5. [0:16:35]
 So I'm going to set a height here of around 2 millimeters and a length of 25 millimeters. [0:16:47]
 So at that moment this is still mobile and we can decide where this is going to go. [0:16:52]
 I might change the dimensions of these in a moment so I just pull these out and 2 millimeters [0:16:58]
 might be too much here and let's go for something like 1.5 mil and we can set this in [0:17:07]
 distance away from this point or we'll use this point and this point sets in distance away [0:17:15]
 and so that's 10 mil. [0:17:18]
 So that's your way to place this. [0:17:20]
 This is just to help position the lid when we add the screws through the holes. [0:17:27]
 Let's come up to the top one and we're going to use the points and keep those in line and [0:17:36]
 the same with this point. [0:17:38]
 So we don't have to worry about length so this will stay still now but it still allows [0:17:46]
 for the height so I'm going to take this line and this line for zoom in, those two so those [0:17:54]
 two and make those equal and the last thing we have to do is set the distance away of 0.5 millimeters. [0:18:05]
 So we've got those in there. We also need to do the same with important line in this side so [0:18:14]
 I'm just going to zoom out and use the section of you so I can see this again and import this [0:18:20]
 inside edge so using the import tool grab that inside edge that projects it onto the sketch [0:18:26]
 uses section of you to get rid of it and do the same so I'm going to use the rectangle [0:18:34]
 and a rectangle in here and we'll set the length of this side equal to length of this side [0:18:45]
 of the height of this side equals and I'm going to make symmetrical so I take these two points [0:18:53]
 and this line and use the symmetric constraint. Let's get rid of the redundant constraint because [0:19:02]
 we've got vertical constraints in there and delete that and now let's set some distance away [0:19:07]
 again, these two points distance away, 0.5 millimeters and we're sets in length of 15mm. [0:19:19]
 Now we've got these we're going to do the same with this circle so if you think about what's [0:19:30]
 happening is that with our box body this one here this is going to come down and I want this to be [0:19:39]
 inside some kind of structure to keep it still add in strength to it and making our life easier [0:19:45]
 when we're screwing the box onto the top so let's come back to the box lid and what we're going to [0:19:52]
 do is I'm going to add a point to this circle and I'm going to take that point and keep it in line [0:20:02]
 with this point. Get those in line like so that means I can use this point to set some distance away [0:20:10]
 so I want this again something like 0.5 millimeters away from this point here so that's add the [0:20:18]
 circle and again I need to add a point onto the circle and take this point and keep it in line [0:20:31]
 with this point so using the constraint horizontal so we've got those in there and now I can come in [0:20:40]
 and take these two points and set a length in here of 0.5 millimeters. Now keep that 0.5 [0:20:51]
 millimeters away there you can adjust this to what you want by just going from 0.5 there and we'll add [0:20:58]
 another circle and this will create the outside walls of this feature and again add a point [0:21:07]
 it's okay take this point and the center point keep those in line horizontal constraint [0:21:16]
 and then take this one and this one and we can set the distance away from there I'm going to set [0:21:26]
 this two a millimeter so we've got that in there now what we can do is do the same on the [0:21:34]
 other side but all we need to do is take two circles one for the inner one for the outer take the [0:21:47]
 inner one, one side and inner one of the top make those equal and then take the outer one and the [0:21:55]
 outer one here and make those equal so that's been constrained with the diameter that's been calculated [0:22:02]
 through placing some point geometry on here and setting them in distance away that's close [0:22:08]
 that now it's fully constrained and we've got these features on this box click on the sketch [0:22:15]
 and use the pad you can see we've pad in those features now now we just need to pad those a [0:22:23]
 little ways so I'm going to pad those two millimeters and have a look see what it looks like so you [0:22:28]
 can see we've got those in there it's up to you if you want to drop this two say one millimeter [0:22:35]
 then that's fine so we've got that feature there and now we're going to come over to the other side [0:22:43]
 and sketch on this face and this is where we're going to place the holes so let the bottom face [0:22:47]
 we're going to create a sketch and we'll add some angle to this and have a look see what we've got [0:22:55]
 and I'm going to pull in this geometry here so I'm going to pull in these holes again [0:23:01]
 using the external geometry pulling these two circles hit the right mass bump to get the mass [0:23:12]
 point back if this is getting in the way this face here comes into the model and just click on [0:23:19]
 that pad and press the spacebar so we're just dealing with the sketch I don't need to do that so [0:23:25]
 I'm going to press spacebar again just to bring it back so now I'm thinking about the shaft of the [0:23:30]
 bolt or the screw that's going to go in here I'm going to create two holes and pocket them [0:23:36]
 so the first hole I'm going to pocket all the way through and that's going to be the size of the [0:23:40]
 bolt the second hole is going to be the size of the bolt head so it's allowing it to be in set [0:23:47]
 into this material I'm going to set both these circles diameter of two millimeters [0:23:56]
 go to task hit close and we're just going to pocket that through using the pocket [0:24:02]
 and we'll set it going through all it's gone all the way through and out the other side [0:24:10]
 okay that's and now we're creating enough sketch on top of that and we'll sketch and this is not [0:24:20]
 going to go all the way through but what we're just going to do is pulling these circles [0:24:25]
 standard geometry like so this gives us the points to place the circles upon [0:24:33]
 add a circle [0:24:34]
 going for the bottom it's a coincidence to that center we've got the order constraints on [0:24:44]
 so we just roll over and it's a coincidence to that center and we take these two [0:24:50]
 trust like those and set the diameter now this is going to be the bolt head so we'll say [0:24:57]
 four millimeters on there it's got to be slightly bigger than the bolt head that's close that [0:25:01]
 now we've got those in there that's pocket that and set this to around about [0:25:09]
 1.5 millimeters so what we've done is allowed for the bolt to sit in there so the bolt [0:25:18]
 body goes through the hole and the bolt head sits within here so what we've done is created [0:25:24]
 a number of features through pants and the front side space so we've just got the top pad there [0:25:35]
 we've got the pocket hole going all the way through and the other pocket and this one here [0:25:42]
 left of the bolt head I'm going to mirror all three of these features make sure you save as you go [0:25:48]
 along so I'm going to select the first feature I want to mirror which is the pad [0:25:54]
 controls that the next one and then the pocket so I selected all three of those features [0:26:00]
 no need to select this one because if I press the space around that it's just the rectangle that's [0:26:07]
 been padded it's the features along the left hand side which I want to mirror these three [0:26:13]
 set all those and come up to part design apply a pattern and mirror it also available from the [0:26:23]
 toolbar here you can see what's happened the mirror parameters are the pad the pocket and the pocket [0:26:29]
 001 which we've selected and you can see how they've been mirrored across to the other side [0:26:35]
 and you can see what axis it's being used the vertical sketch axis if I change that then it's [0:26:45]
 going to be mirrored in a different direction which is not the direction we want so we can just change [0:26:51]
 that vertical sketch axis and see those there so let's mirror it on both sides that's okay that's [0:26:58]
 so we've got our basically finished lid so our lid is finished the thing that we're missing [0:27:06]
 is the thread in and the holes on the other side so on the box side I'm just going to hide the [0:27:13]
 binder in here and save this that's come over to the box body and I'm going to create holes [0:27:24]
 against these here again I'm going to create a sketch on there and I'm going to mirror it across [0:27:30]
 so take one of the faces of those stalks and create a sketch I'm going to import the geometry [0:27:40]
 of that circle there using external geometry click on it import it there we import the [0:27:49]
 other one as well because we need that and then I'm going to create two circles just in [0:27:55]
 so I make sure you don't touch anything because I'll try to get into that place in those tangent [0:28:00]
 to the circle so if I try that coming to the center and I touch that circle there you can see [0:28:05]
 it got tangent's coming up and it will come up as over constraint and we don't want that so I'm [0:28:11]
 let that and hit delete and we'll make sure that those circles are okay so those are okay [0:28:19]
 and with the hole it doesn't matter about the size of the circle because the whole tool actually [0:28:26]
 allows you to specify that hole so we take the circle and the outer circle and make those equal [0:28:33]
 it doesn't seem right but when you see the next step you'll see what's happening make those equal [0:28:39]
 so we've got those sketches on there as it closed we're going to be using this tool here was a [0:28:46]
 selected sketch the hole the sketch is selected and we set the hole or can't have to part design [0:28:51]
 this is a subtractive feature and click hole those are finished and if we look and what's happened [0:29:01]
 is all to do with the diameter so we can reduce this diameter down to whatever diamond we want [0:29:07]
 now if you're using a non-fredded technique to place these together so if you're using a screw [0:29:13]
 or you're creating your own threads in there then this is where you set your diameter so if you [0:29:18]
 go to the tab out of those threads then you can use that what I want to do is use the profile [0:29:24]
 and select one of these profiles for a stand-fredts song and up go ISO metric regular profile [0:29:32]
 and I'm going to click threaded we've got the direction the thread use them right hand [0:29:39]
 thread and now can select what size I want so I can go up to an m2 and you can see those have [0:29:45]
 been increased in size m3 etc so I'm going to go for an m4 thread like so now if I wanted this to [0:29:58]
 freely print we click on model thread as well nothing's happened as of yet I can click up a view [0:30:07]
 but this is the reason why I'm doing this last because this is the last action I'm going to [0:30:12]
 apply to this box because it takes a little while to do and also it's going to create a number of [0:30:16]
 faces for those threads I click up a view to see what it looks like but I'm quite happy with that [0:30:22]
 the other thing that I want to watch out for is the depth so we've got the depth there [0:30:28]
 so we can go through all or just dimension and I'm going to set the depth [0:30:33]
 250 millimeters so now we've got all the parameters in there if I hit okay what I have to do is just [0:30:45]
 wait a little while to put those threads to render once they're rendered then what you'll see [0:30:50]
 if I zoom in you can see we've got the thread inside there so that's the last action well I say [0:31:00]
 last action all we need to do now is take the whole and use a mirror to mirror it over to the other [0:31:05]
 side so let to the feature that I want to mirror and this time I'm going to be using the mirror [0:31:11]
 from the toolbar and this will mirror it over to the other side like so [0:31:16]
 and we're here okay again this may take a little while because of the thread in [0:31:22]
 and we've got the thread in on both sides so we've got our simple box with threaded mounts [0:31:31]
 and also we've got the box lid and this one here [0:31:38]
 now at this point I've realized that the holes in here are the wrong diameters [0:31:47]
 so let's go back to where those holes were created so we got that pocket there the pocket [0:31:53]
 and so it's going to be in here I'll click on that sketch [0:31:59]
 and we've got those holes in there two millimeters so we can just set these [0:32:05]
 to three millimeters or whatever size our thread in is so I've closed that and bring back the mirror [0:32:14]
 we can see that's taken effect and we just matched those holes two our box body mirrored [0:32:23]
 and whatever size this thread in is so we come back to the hole [0:32:31]
 and you can see we've got thread in here so we've got a size of M4 and I'm just going to drop this [0:32:40]
 down to an M3 and click off this will recalculate so we have to wait a little while remember that [0:32:47]
 we've got the hole and the mirror to recalculate this is the reason why we do it last and we've got that [0:32:54]
 in there all set to go but you've got the freedom to adjust those holes if you want [0:33:03]
 so for instance you can come back in and just change this to 3.5 or 3.2 so I'd [0:33:10]
 lower extra to that and close that and everything will recalculate so we've got the lid and the body [0:33:16]
 and we save that, hit control s and if we change items across both those documents then it will [0:33:24]
 save both them together so those are both saved now so what do these look like together [0:33:30]
 well we could use and assembly what bench to put those together or what I'm going to do is use the [0:33:36]
 link feature now this allows you to link in objects into a new document or the same document the same [0:33:43]
 processes what we did with the shape I know it's a great a new document and I'm just going to save it [0:33:50]
 file save as call it box assembly and we're coming to the box body this one here and I'm going [0:34:00]
 to slap the body just click on that body and it's the same process make sure that we got the [0:34:06]
 body selected come over to the box assembly tab make sure we don't click anything in this view [0:34:11]
 and come up to this link icon here make link that pulls that in from that document [0:34:18]
 and you can see on the left hand side we've got the body there so click on that and have a look down [0:34:26]
 you can see we've got some information on where it's coming from so the tip is mirrored we can see [0:34:33]
 it's part of a group of sketch pad thickness etc etc that's come over to the box lid and do the [0:34:40]
 click on the box lid body and then click on the box assembly tab must be the tab [0:34:47]
 and click the link so we've got the lid and the body what we can do now in this file [0:34:54]
 I'm just going to save it is I'm going to take that lid right click transform and I can move [0:35:03]
 that about and flip it over let's get the right one this one here and see what that's going to [0:35:11]
 look like against the body let's bring that in there that's okay that and the good thing is that we [0:35:18]
 got transparency as well so I can click on this mirrored what I's click the body you can see [0:35:23]
 will links within there to all the different items click on the body come down to the view [0:35:30]
 and that's how we look see what we got so we've got shape color etc etc and I'm going to set the [0:35:36]
 transparency to 80 so we can see in there and we can see what's going on inside [0:35:43]
 so you can see the fret in there you can see the stalk the holds that fret and how it sits [0:35:54]
 in that feature inside there and you can see these features and how far away they are from the edge [0:36:00]
 and any adjustments whether we do to the part design models will get reflected in that link [0:36:07]
 so it's a quick way you've put an assembly together and see in how it all fits together [0:36:13]
 you can export these so if I go far export or use the mesh workbench they export as an STL [0:36:22]
 so we can actually export those straight from that box assembly to allow for 3D printing if I [0:36:28]
 slip both of them and export then we let both of them together and export them out as a component [0:36:38]
 part in the STL so you can see we got full control with the shape binders and the link to get an [0:36:46]
 idea of what our model looks like and to construct how model across multiple files hope you enjoy [0:36:52]
