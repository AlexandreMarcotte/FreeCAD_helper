===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD for Beginners 25- Spherical Pocket - Part Design - Additive - Subtractive Primitives =====
 Hi everyone, welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of Learning [0:00:04]
 FreeCalf of Beginners teaching the fundamentals of freecad whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:08]
 Today we're looking at a part design workflow and we're actually answering a patient's [0:00:12]
 question at the same time. [0:00:14]
 The question is regarding spherical pockets. [0:00:17]
 Now taking this opportunity to go into the subtractive and the additive primitives in part [0:00:25]
 design. [0:00:26]
 What these allow you to do is create such pockets as this so you can see this feature [0:00:31]
 here is a spherical pocket with some pockets in here to remove a hole and this arc here. [0:00:44]
 So we can place a bead that's attached to a wire into this and it will pour against [0:00:51]
 this pocket so we can create some kind of assembly in there. [0:00:55]
 We have a break wire or a wire or something that's controlled in a much larger construction. [0:01:01]
 I've also included the ellipse and this is an example of enough affirmative geometry [0:01:06]
 that you can create where we've taken both in an additive and subtractive route to create [0:01:11]
 this hood out the lips here. [0:01:13]
 This may look a bit different to what you actually create in the end and the only reason [0:01:18]
 is I've used a refine on here. [0:01:21]
 So I click on this we can see the pocket on here. [0:01:24]
 If you come down we can see this refine is true. [0:01:28]
 If I set this to false then we're going to get a few more faces in here. [0:01:34]
 So I hope you're enjoying these series and that's how to look at these tools. [0:01:39]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:02:03]
 So I'm in free catalog. [0:02:04]
 We're already started a new document. [0:02:05]
 I'm in the part design. [0:02:07]
 We're going to be using the additive features here for the additive primitive and the [0:02:13]
 destructive primitive. [0:02:15]
 Also available from part design create a subtractive primitive and create an additive [0:02:21]
 primitive and we've got the selection here of box and the sphere cone, lipsoid, or [0:02:26]
 etc. [0:02:27]
 Now these are very similar to the part workbench workflow where we have these primitives [0:02:33]
 here and also additional primitives on the creative primitive geometrism primitives where [0:02:40]
 we have prism, lipsoid, etc. [0:02:43]
 Here as well. [0:02:44]
 It's going to close that and come back over to the part design. [0:02:50]
 Now the reason why you would choose say these features over the part is totally up to you [0:02:56]
 but with the part design there's an automatic fusion between these and any other geometry [0:03:02]
 you place on top of them as long as they're touching. [0:03:05]
 With a part for using compounds or multiple objects then you'll use that workflow. [0:03:11]
 To use these we can select the cube and we get a cube there we get a primitive cube. [0:03:20]
 Now we've got nothing to actually attach this to. [0:03:22]
 We can select a plane and we place upon planes so you can see the plane there, click [0:03:27]
 the plane and we can place it along in those planes. [0:03:32]
 So these actually come into our own, I'm just going to cancel that, is I'm going to create [0:03:36]
 new body and I'm going to create a sketch. [0:03:39]
 I'm going to place this along the x-wild plane and I'm going to use a combination of [0:03:44]
 a additive and a subtractive primitive. [0:03:48]
 For this I'm going to make a spherical pocket. [0:03:52]
 So we're going to create something like a slot. [0:03:55]
 We've got the autoconstraints and the void redundant constraints already on there and what [0:04:00]
 we'll do is take these two points and this point make it symmetrical. [0:04:05]
 It's placed in length and we're just adding some rough dimensions in here. [0:04:13]
 Some two five millimeters and a radius or diameter and we'll use diameter of 20mm. [0:04:22]
 So we've got this geometry in here and we'll close it and what we're going to do is do [0:04:27]
 a pad or five millimeters and today it's a bit more interesting. [0:04:32]
 Let's take the top face and create a thickness or a part design. [0:04:38]
 It's a dress up and we're select the thickness. [0:04:42]
 Now we'll make the walls, something like 3mm thick. [0:04:46]
 Click off and make the thickness inwards. [0:04:49]
 Might actually go for two mil. [0:04:51]
 There. [0:04:52]
 Right, so I know, okay. [0:04:55]
 So we have this shape. [0:04:57]
 I want to create a spherical pocket and I'm thinking that it's going to hold some kind [0:05:04]
 of wiring there so we'll have some kind of metal bead that sits in that spherical pocket [0:05:09]
 that's attached to a wire. [0:05:11]
 Similar like you get on bicycle gears or something that's control via a wire in some [0:05:16]
 kind of assembly. [0:05:18]
 So if we go to this face, if I click on it and what we're going to do is come out to the [0:05:23]
 part design and our first going to create an additive primitive and I'm going to pick [0:05:30]
 the sphere. [0:05:32]
 Now the sphere will be added with some diameter but it's going to be added to the center [0:05:38]
 of origin. [0:05:40]
 So let me just cancel that and go view toggle axis cross so we can see the center of origin [0:05:47]
 of our scene in there. [0:05:49]
 So that's that top and we'll select the additive primitive this time from the toolbar. [0:05:55]
 So we've got the sphere. [0:05:58]
 We can move this sphere by using both attachment and also the attachment offset. [0:06:06]
 Which will come available once we're attached. [0:06:08]
 Make sure this is saying, selecting if it doesn't then we can just click on it and I'm [0:06:13]
 going to select this outer circle here. [0:06:18]
 And you can see the sphere is moved. [0:06:21]
 If I wanted to change this then I just click on this again so it's saying select him and [0:06:27]
 select say the inner circle. [0:06:29]
 So we've got the sphere there. [0:06:31]
 If we look up the top we can see the radius. [0:06:36]
 So I'm going to increase this radius to 8mm and you can see how that sits. [0:06:43]
 Let's go about 7mm. [0:06:47]
 Now if I accidentally picked the exit plane there so you can see how if we pick something [0:06:52]
 else then it's going to change where it's going to set. [0:06:57]
 So I want it in here. [0:07:01]
 So that sphere at the moment sits in this position. [0:07:06]
 We can change the placement of this because I want this sphere coming out the bottom half [0:07:10]
 of it coming out the bottom and we can change the placement of that because we come down [0:07:14]
 we can see the offset. [0:07:15]
 He's here. [0:07:16]
 We're not going to change this just yet. [0:07:18]
 We're going to do is look at the U and V parameters. [0:07:22]
 And you can see we've got 360 degrees. [0:07:26]
 This means that we can change the sphere to be like a half sphere, a quarter sphere, etc. [0:07:32]
 So if I change this on the U and I'm going to press down arrow key you can see that it's [0:07:39]
 starting to move parts of sphere along this axis. [0:07:45]
 Now if that's a wrong axis then we can experiment with the other axis. [0:07:50]
 So let's just reset that to 360 to get our false sphere and that's place a bit of angle on [0:07:57]
 this and look at the V parameter. [0:08:00]
 So at the moment it's minus 90 and again if I click on this and increase this by pressing [0:08:07]
 the upper arrow key we can see nothing's happening at the moment but if we look at the bottom [0:08:13]
 and increases up we can see we get in a different effect on the bottom. [0:08:21]
 So I don't need to change this one. [0:08:23]
 So I'm going to set that back to minus 90. [0:08:26]
 I need to change this one here because I want to reduce the top of the sphere down so it's [0:08:32]
 a half sphere. [0:08:36]
 Press the down arrow key and you can see that's starting to move down. [0:08:49]
 Let's go to zero so we get half of the sphere. [0:08:54]
 Now I've got half of the sphere I want to attach it to the bottom. [0:08:59]
 So at the moment I've attached it to this circle here. [0:09:04]
 We come around and click the selecting again. [0:09:07]
 Make sure I set the selecting and click on this one then it touches it to the bottom. [0:09:15]
 And if we want to change any offset of this for instance that's coming and change [0:09:25]
 the in X direction and Y direction and we're looking at this navigation down here so [0:09:30]
 that is this way. [0:09:31]
 Now just accidentally touched this face of this click on that edge there, [0:09:37]
 put in the correct place and it's come to in Z direction and press the up key and you can [0:09:46]
 see how that's disappearing upwards and we can bring it through the top like so. [0:09:54]
 So this sphere actually starts in line with this surface or we can bring it further up. [0:10:05]
 And I'm going to go for that. [0:10:06]
 So I've just got the poking out through the top there. [0:10:10]
 Let's come up and hit OK. [0:10:14]
 So we've got the sphere in place. [0:10:16]
 Now we can change that if we want by coming into the model and you can see the last action, [0:10:21]
 the tip action because it's a part design process is the sphere. [0:10:25]
 We've got that little green arrow sitting there and we can change the radius and all of the [0:10:34]
 angle one, angle two, angle three etc. [0:10:39]
 So now I've created this. [0:10:41]
 I've got the face of the sphere. [0:10:43]
 Why I can do now is if I want to the hole out this then I click that face and this time [0:10:50]
 I'm going to come out to put design create a subtractive primitive and use the sphere again. [0:10:56]
 You can see it hasn't attached to that face so we're just click that face again and it's there. [0:11:02]
 This time the radius is going to set to something like 6 millimeters and just have a look to see what [0:11:06]
 that looks like. [0:11:09]
 That's good. [0:11:10]
 And I know this sphere is in line. [0:11:14]
 The middle of the sphere is in line with this circle so I don't have to change the in Z direction. [0:11:23]
 If I hit OK now what that will do is pocket out that sphere. [0:11:29]
 Like so. [0:11:31]
 So now we've got a spherical pocket and we can continue with our process. [0:11:37]
 Let's say we wanted to take this face and say add a sketch up on here and we'll add a circle. [0:11:48]
 And though I've picked this face I'm actually adding the circle to this point which means [0:11:54]
 I can close and I can pocket all the way through and we go through all out of place that [0:12:04]
 whole all the way through there. [0:12:07]
 OK and again I can take this face or this face here and add another sketch and we can [0:12:16]
 add say an arc from here to here and we're going to create a slot in here. [0:12:26]
 Now I've picked the wrong arc so I'm going to come in and pick the endpoint to the endpoint [0:12:30]
 arc and attach to that line. [0:12:33]
 Come out and create some kind of arc in here either side. [0:12:41]
 Like so. [0:12:44]
 We use line tool to connect up these two points and these two points in here. [0:12:54]
 I think I've actually missed that one so I can take this one and this one and this one. [0:13:00]
 Point on point constraint get rid of the predominant constraints by clicking on it and hitting [0:13:07]
 the lead and I can constrain these down with some dimensions but I'm just going to place this [0:13:15]
 in here well I's placed a dimension in here this one length here of millimeter and we set this [0:13:23]
 length using the distance of a millimeter as well and make these two equal. [0:13:33]
 That do for now we'll hit close we can see that sketch sits intersect in this wall here. [0:13:42]
 Now I've got that sketch in place we're going to pocket this all the way through so let's use a [0:13:48]
 pocket and we can see we've gone downwards so if I go through all that will take me all the way through [0:13:57]
 that feature there but I want to go basically all the way through and out the other side of [0:14:05]
 course so we want to take away this wall. Now normally if we go symmetrical to plane this will [0:14:10]
 take us up but you can see we've got a problem here so we're going to do is cancel out of there [0:14:17]
 we've attached this sketch to this face so we need to change the attachment. [0:14:24]
 I'm going to attach it to this face to allow me to go down from this face downwards. [0:14:30]
 To click on the sketch you see the support say as pocket face 13 which is this one in here [0:14:39]
 so you look down on the left hand side at the bottom you see face 13 on a hover over. [0:14:45]
 I want to change it to this face here so we take the support and click the button on the end [0:14:51]
 and we can see this is hard to pocket that's clear that and now we can select [0:14:57]
 somewhere else to position it now I can select the x y plane and hit okay and that will place it upon the [0:15:04]
 x y plane and you can see it's been positioned there at the point of origin. I would have to change [0:15:12]
 the attachment to actually raises up and place it in the correct place or I can use the button [0:15:18]
 the gain clear and this time we'll select the face and hit okay so let's place it on the top face here [0:15:29]
 now when I'll pocket this using the pocket tool we can see we're going down and we're going [0:15:39]
 through all and we get the effect that we want and here okay so what I've done is coming to the [0:15:47]
 part design and I've just cleared out all we had in there before and we're going to talk some more [0:15:52]
 about these primitive features. Now obviously if we've got nothing in there we can't use the [0:15:56]
 strategy feature because it's going to pull up an error because we can't subtract from nothing [0:16:01]
 there's got to be some kind of feature some kind of base feature there and that can be either [0:16:06]
 done by a sketch and pattern it or creating the primitive feature so I'm coming here and that's [0:16:14]
 great an additive ellipsoid we then have something that we can use it's going to replace at the point [0:16:22]
 of origin so if I okay that with the two and four and then create another ellipsoid this time [0:16:33]
 it's attractive then this is going to be placed inside here at the center point and what we're [0:16:40]
 doing is reduce this down to one and three and here okay this is now hollow so if I come into this [0:16:54]
 ellipsoid here you can see when I roll over it we've got a void inside here so you can see that inside [0:17:02]
 if I took the original ellipsoid and look at the angle and that's changed the 360 to something like [0:17:09]
 180 and here enter we can see once it's recomputed then that's half that original ellipsoid [0:17:20]
 and we've got that's attractive feature that's being removed from inside there so this opens [0:17:28]
 up the possibilities of complex shapes but we get to the point of when we're trying to place [0:17:34]
 items on here it can be quite hard because we've got the plan of surface but we've got this [0:17:40]
 surface here and trying to place the sketch upon here it's saying you need a plan of face as a [0:17:46]
 support now we could use the base planes the XY base planes and also we could use something called [0:17:55]
 a datum plane and what we're going to do is actually go into that in a separate video so I hope [0:18:01]
