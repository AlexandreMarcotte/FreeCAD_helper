===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD for Beginners 26- Part Design Features on Non-Planar Faces and Curved Surfaces =====
 everyone welcome to the channel and welcome back to another episode with free cap for beginners. [0:00:04]
 We'll be teaching the fundamentals of free CAD whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:08]
 Today we're going to be using a part design workflow and learn how to create features such as these [0:00:14]
 on non-planar faces. [0:00:16]
 So we have this model here. [0:00:18]
 The features we're going to create are these pad and pockets that have been placed long here. [0:00:25]
 We're going to be learning how to groove out this feature here. [0:00:28]
 That runs all the way along and how to attach these features to non-planar faces. [0:00:34]
 We're not going to be using data planes, we're not going to be using the Curthworkbench. [0:00:38]
 We're looking at basic sketch attachment and how to use scaffolding sketches [0:00:44]
 to allow for these features. [0:00:47]
 So this is different from construction geometry. [0:00:49]
 This is a scaffold sketch that we can use to align and attach our sketch [0:00:54]
 to the surfaces and faces. [0:00:56]
 I hope you enjoy this series and let's have a look at this technique. [0:00:59]

 So for this demonstration we're going to be creating a mudguard mount and this has a number of surfaces [0:01:30]
 that are not planar that we need to add features against. [0:01:33]
 For this I'm great, a new body and new sketch, longly x-y plane and here okay. [0:01:40]
 Now I can start sketching. [0:01:43]
 First thing I'm going to add is a circle. [0:01:46]
 I'm going to set the diameter just gets an idea of how dimensions. [0:01:51]
 Let's come over to the constraint of the diameter [0:01:58]
 and set this to 50mm. [0:02:02]
 I'll create a number of lines and we're going to use these as construction geometry. [0:02:09]
 I'm going to set the angle between these two lines. [0:02:14]
 Use an angle constraint and set it to 72 degrees. [0:02:19]
 I'm going to do the same between these two. [0:02:22]
 Game of the angle constraint and set that to 40 degrees. [0:02:28]
 We'll use these as construction geometry. [0:02:31]
 So what we need to do is take these two lines and set them to construction geometry. [0:02:37]
 Now there's an icon on the toolbar to do this. [0:02:39]
 There's toggle construction geometry or we just come out to sketch [0:02:44]
 sketch geometries and toggle construction geometry. [0:02:50]
 They become blue. [0:02:51]
 They won't sharpen the sketch when we close it so you can see which is got the circle there. [0:02:56]
 Let's come back into that sketch. [0:02:58]
 Next I'm going to create an arc. [0:03:02]
 Now I'm going to create a center and endpoint arc. [0:03:04]
 I've got my order constraints on and I've already done the order constraints. [0:03:10]
 That means when I hover over that center point we could coincidence constraint [0:03:14]
 which are going to use by clicking. [0:03:16]
 Come up to the top, get a point of line constraint. [0:03:20]
 We come around and connect up to a construction geometry [0:03:23]
 with a point of line constraint as well. [0:03:27]
 Why I'm here I'm going to set this arc radius using the radius constraint. [0:03:32]
 I'm going to set that to 35 millimeters. [0:03:38]
 Next I'm going to create a line between this point [0:03:42]
 and this construction geometry. [0:03:45]
 I make sure that this line and the arc are tangent to each other. [0:03:50]
 We get a sketch constraint substitution which allows that tangency to flow. [0:03:57]
 We're still for the constraint so now we can add a second arc. [0:04:02]
 I'm going to use an endpoint to pinpoint our this time. [0:04:06]
 I'm going to create an arc here. [0:04:08]
 Hit escape with the right mouse button to get the mouse button to bank and use the arc [0:04:14]
 and the line again adding tangency. [0:04:17]
 Now I'm going to add constraint to that over around 25 millimeters. [0:04:26]
 That's the radius there. [0:04:28]
 I'm now going to create another arc coming from this one. [0:04:33]
 This is going to be quite shallow arc. [0:04:36]
 It's going to travel over this way. [0:04:38]
 Using the arc of gain, [0:04:42]
 endpoints and endpoints and windpoints. [0:04:43]
 We're creating another arc. [0:04:45]
 That's it's here. [0:04:46]
 Again we add tangency between these two. [0:04:49]
 Using the tangency. [0:04:51]
 Okay that. [0:04:53]
 And now I'm going to move over to the other side. [0:04:56]
 And add a line between here. [0:05:00]
 This circle all the way down connecting up on this line. [0:05:03]
 I'm going to take this point and the point of this arc and keep them in the line. [0:05:11]
 So those will be kept in line. [0:05:14]
 I can now add some hiding here. [0:05:18]
 But first of all I'm going to come out to the top and place a line in here as well. [0:05:24]
 From this point and connect it up to the circle. [0:05:27]
 This is constrained. [0:05:29]
 We're going to do is use the trin tool or come up to the sketch. [0:05:34]
 Sketch geometries and trim edge and trim out this circle. [0:05:41]
 So we just get the arc here. [0:05:43]
 Next I'm going to place another arc and this time from here to here and create an arc. [0:05:53]
 I'm going to hit escape or press right mouse button. [0:05:57]
 I'm just going to move this over here and place a line that connects up between this point [0:06:02]
 and this point closing the geometry. [0:06:04]
 We now need to add our constraints. [0:06:06]
 So this arc here I'm going to add a constraint using the radius. [0:06:09]
 This can be quite high so this can be 260 millimeters. [0:06:13]
 Now it's important to understand the center point of this arc is going to be way out here. [0:06:19]
 Now this is going to come in handy in a moment. [0:06:21]
 So now I'm going to take this arc and also add some radius. [0:06:28]
 And about 460. [0:06:31]
 You can see we need some more constraints in here. [0:06:38]
 So I'm going to set a height 18. [0:06:43]
 And this distance away here, alt 20. [0:06:52]
 And we'll set some length here. [0:06:57]
 Over 115. [0:07:02]
 Finding we set some length here. [0:07:08]
 Over 100. [0:07:13]
 So there's quite a few constraints in here. [0:07:17]
 A lot of them are radius constraints. [0:07:20]
 And we've got some length constraints in here. [0:07:26]
 So it can look a bit messy but we can neat these up by coming over. [0:07:30]
 And if we look we've got the angle constraints which we can turn off from the view. [0:07:35]
 And we come down. [0:07:40]
 But it length's the radius. [0:07:44]
 And we can just hide those from the view. [0:07:47]
 So we've got this constraints. [0:07:48]
 Cluttering our workspace. [0:07:51]
 And we can select them from the screen as well just to highlight them and just uncheck. [0:07:58]
 Once we are happy, then we can close. [0:08:06]
 And now we can pad this and I'm going to pad it 20 millimeters. [0:08:13]
 So we've got this shape. [0:08:16]
 For the next step, I'm going to remove some material from in here using a subtractive sweep. [0:08:23]
 Also known as a subtractive pipe. [0:08:25]
 We're going to be using this edge through the material using a profile on this plan of face. [0:08:32]
 Now you can see this face here is plan up because it's been made up of straight geometry. [0:08:38]
 This face here won't be plan up because it's been made up of an arc. [0:08:42]
 So if I create a sketch upon there, it says you need a plan of face. [0:08:46]
 I support for a sketch. [0:08:48]
 This one is plan up because it's a straight line. [0:08:50]
 It's been made up and we can create a sketch on there. [0:08:53]
 Let's close that and just delete that sketch. [0:08:56]
 So the first thing I want to do is remove material from here so I'm going to select that face and create a new sketch. [0:09:03]
 Our sketch is flush with that face, that plan of face. [0:09:09]
 So I'm going to import the geometry, I can import the points. [0:09:14]
 And I want to make a groove in here to these two points here. [0:09:18]
 And we create let's say a simple sketch of a slot. [0:09:26]
 Hit a scape, get my last point back and which can play sound position. [0:09:31]
 I want something like that. [0:09:35]
 I'm going to take this point and this point [0:09:42]
 zoom in, grab that point and just keep those in mind. [0:09:48]
 It sets in distance away. [0:09:51]
 So these two points, [0:09:53]
 set length around about five millimeters. [0:10:00]
 I'm going to do the same on the other side as well. [0:10:03]
 So coming in this point and this point, [0:10:06]
 set those at five mil. [0:10:10]
 We set the diameter or the radius of three millimeters. [0:10:19]
 So I created this profile against this face. [0:10:23]
 If I hit close, you can see that profile there. [0:10:27]
 That sketch is sitting there. [0:10:29]
 Notice the angle. [0:10:31]
 If I used this profile to remove material from here, [0:10:36]
 using a subtracted sweep, we're going to get into a bit of a problem. [0:10:40]
 Because this angle will leave material here. [0:10:45]
 Let me show you what happens. [0:10:48]
 So using that sketch and coming out to the part design, [0:10:54]
 create a subtracted feature, [0:10:57]
 subtracted pipe. [0:10:58]
 And then add edge, you can see the object that's been selected for the profile [0:11:04]
 is sketch zero zero one, which is this one here. [0:11:06]
 Click add edge, I can add the edges that I want to remove. [0:11:12]
 And you can see how that's being removed along there. [0:11:15]
 But when I get to the top and have a little what's happened, [0:11:21]
 you can see the angle that's at. [0:11:23]
 Now we've got two choices here. [0:11:28]
 If I hit OK, what you'll find is that we get [0:11:31]
 part of this face at an angle, which matches the same angle here. [0:11:37]
 Being removed, but I want to remove this as well. [0:11:42]
 Now I can create the same sketch on here, [0:11:44]
 and use as a distant profile. [0:11:46]
 I'll come into the subtracted pipe and change the section transform to multi-section. [0:11:51]
 First of all, we'll need a sketch upon here. [0:11:56]
 So we need the same sketch, basically what we had here. [0:11:59]
 I can copy the sketch, but it's quite easy to create that sketch on that face. [0:12:04]
 I can go that face, create a sketch. [0:12:06]
 Again, I'm going to come in and pull in the two points. [0:12:12]
 Create a slot, making sure that the points are in line. [0:12:23]
 And also making sure there are five millimeters away. [0:12:28]
 Same on this side. [0:12:31]
 And setting centimeter or even radius or free mill. [0:12:43]
 Therefore, when I close what we can do now is go back to the subtracted pipe. [0:12:52]
 Come down to the section transform and create a multi-section transform in here. [0:13:00]
 This means that I can add another section. [0:13:03]
 If I click add and we come up to our sketch, if I click on the sketch, [0:13:07]
 that adds it in there. [0:13:09]
 And you can see that has changed. [0:13:12]
 If I click OK now, we get that running all the way through. [0:13:19]
 The other way, if I delete that subtractive pipe, [0:13:25]
 we've got the two sketches. That's bring back the sketch here. [0:13:30]
 Let's see what happens when I do the same. [0:13:33]
 This time use the subtractive pipe from the toolbar. [0:13:38]
 And we've got it selected. Sketch 0.02. So the profile here, [0:13:43]
 which is now pointing straight up. [0:13:47]
 And we add the edges working the opposite direction. [0:13:53]
 And here, OK. [0:14:00]
 We get the same problem. [0:14:04]
 And that it doesn't come out the other side. [0:14:08]
 But this may be the fact that you want. You may want this grooving here and it's just a stop. [0:14:16]
 At this point. If we want it to go all the way through, [0:14:21]
 that's add another edge. We could use this edge as well. [0:14:24]
 And here, OK. And we've got all the way through. [0:14:28]
 Add to the groove all the way along there. [0:14:31]
 So now we've got this. How do we add features on here? [0:14:37]
 So this surface here, add an sketch when it's a planofase. [0:14:44]
 So I want to create some holes in here. First I want to pad and then I want to create a smaller hole in that pad. [0:14:51]
 So we get a raised feature. So this is our next step of how to solve this problem. [0:14:57]
 To solve the problem we've got in the holes and non-planofases, [0:14:59]
 that's move first to a planofase. So let's take this one here. [0:15:03]
 It's been created with planofometry. Now it's important to think [0:15:07]
 how this has been created. The reason why it's planof is because it's been created with a straight line. [0:15:12]
 And also the material has been removed. [0:15:15]
 Has been created with a straight line of that slot geometry in there. [0:15:20]
 So this one here isn't planof. This one isn't planof because it's created with the arc of the slot geometry. [0:15:29]
 And though it's been created with a path that's straight, [0:15:31]
 but this one here we've got a straight path and a straight geometry of the slot geometry. [0:15:38]
 So we create a sketch upon there. You can see how that sketch has been aligned to that face. [0:15:46]
 Now if I create a circle on here, you'll notice that the circle sits flush on that face. [0:15:56]
 And the normal of that sketch runs this way so straight out is normal. [0:16:02]
 And this is what we're looking for because if you look at the angle, it follows the angle [0:16:07]
 of that face. So we need to follow the angle of these faces here. [0:16:14]
 And there's a little trick how to do that without using such things as datum planes or the [0:16:19]
 cursework bench, but we've sketched placement. So let's close that and delete that sketch. [0:16:26]
 We need to first go back to the sketch that was created with this pad. [0:16:32]
 Coming here, that's hide, the straightive pipe by present a spacebar. [0:16:37]
 And coming to the pad and select the sketch, press a spacebar. [0:16:43]
 Double click the sketch and see what we have. [0:16:46]
 There's two faces I want to target to create these holes. [0:16:50]
 And this arc here and this arc here. So the faces that have been created with this geometry. [0:16:56]
 That's zoom out and have a look at the center point of the arc. [0:17:02]
 That creates this arc here. [0:17:05]
 Come back to the constraints and try to find the constraints to do with that arc. [0:17:12]
 So this one here. [0:17:17]
 You'll see an arrow pointing to where that arc is. [0:17:25]
 Now notice if you look at the arc and look at this line. [0:17:29]
 For that line, if we had a hole here, this will be the normal of that sketch. [0:17:38]
 And if we move it to the other side, [0:17:41]
 that line means it's annotated in the correct direction. [0:17:48]
 That's hide that constraint. And this time let's take a line from here and place the line down [0:17:56]
 and I'm going to place another one down as well. [0:18:00]
 So we're going to create two holes in here. [0:18:05]
 Now these lines are going to convert to construction geometry. [0:18:09]
 Two lines and convert them to construction geometry. [0:18:13]
 And I'm going to zoom in now and take these ends and bring them back up. [0:18:19]
 So they're just above and zoom in. [0:18:23]
 So we're creating a construction geometry. We're going to be using lines to orientate our sketch [0:18:31]
 for the holes. So I'm going to create another line now and I'm going to connect a quinscent to this point [0:18:37]
 and attach it to the line the same on this side. [0:18:42]
 Quinscent and point in line constraint. [0:18:45]
 The reason for this is because when I bring these down close up [0:18:52]
 and we'll bring the top down. We can add some length for this. [0:18:57]
 If I come out the sketch now it close. [0:19:01]
 We don't get a massive line going all the way up here. We just get these two lines that sit [0:19:06]
 like so. But you can see a problem. If you look over to the left hand side we can see we can't do this [0:19:14]
 in the current sketch. So I've done this in the sketch in the pad. We can't actually do this. [0:19:19]
 Because what we're doing is creating a sketch that is not fully closed. [0:19:24]
 So let's come back into the sketch and just get rid of these lines. So I'm going to get rid of the [0:19:30]
 construction lines and these two lines here. So we need a way of doing this without destroying this sketch. [0:19:38]
 Let's close out. Now the good thing about street CAD is that one create sketches we can reference [0:19:47]
 a sternal geometry. That doesn't have to be from a solid a surface of face, et cetera. [0:19:53]
 It can be from another sketch. So that's keep this sketch active and create another sketch. [0:20:00]
 It's going to be on the same plane as this sketch, the x, y plane. And here, okay. [0:20:06]
 So now we're on the x, y plane. We've got the sketch that's inside the pad still visible, which is [0:20:15]
 perfect. Come back to task and that's pulling into the geometry. So you're using the external [0:20:21]
 geometry tool and we're going to pull in this arc here. And the same thing happens. We get a [0:20:27]
 point at the top and we get the arc draw our lines. [0:20:33]
 Here's a sketch that I'm asked for in the back or right mouse button and I'm going to step both the lines [0:20:44]
 and make those construction. That's zoom in. [0:20:48]
 And I'm just going to place these lines just above as we did before. And now we create another line [0:20:58]
 from here to here and here. And we're going to position these [0:21:06]
 just below this line. This is going to have to touch the surface of our object. That's it close [0:21:18]
 and you can see those two sitting there. That's bringing back the attractive pipe and see what we have. [0:21:26]
 It's hide the sketch of the pad. We don't need this anymore and collapse the pad. So now we've [0:21:33]
 got a sketch that's inside this body. It's important that it's inside this body because we're [0:21:37]
 going to be reference this in a minute. We've padded 20mm this way. So I'm going to take that sketch [0:21:45]
 of those two lines and come down to the attachment, not the placement and the position. [0:21:52]
 And we're going to move this along the z axis and we're going to move it to 10mm. [0:22:01]
 So that's now in the middle of this object. [0:22:05]
 If we look closer we can see that the sketch is sitting just above this face [0:22:14]
 let's come back into the sketch and have a look at what we've got. I'm going to use the [0:22:22]
 section view. So come up to the section view and if you can't find it it's on sketch [0:22:28]
 a few section and it's section through the middle of that object. [0:22:34]
 I want this sitting on that surface of that object. Now I can bring in this line here [0:22:43]
 as you can see. So that arc and I can use a point on line constraint with this one [0:22:52]
 point on line and this one here point on line. So those are bought in there. [0:23:03]
 Now sometimes when you bring in an arc you'll get a B-spline which you won't be [0:23:10]
 at a touch these points too. So you have to put them in the near vicinity. It won't be [0:23:16]
 constrained down but it'd be near the point where you can actually attach the sketch too. That's [0:23:21]
 hit close. So we've got our lines touching the surface. Now we can create some features [0:23:29]
 for this I'm going to make sure nothing's selected and I'm going to select the sketch. [0:23:34]
 It doesn't matter which plane you place is upon. So I'm just going to go for the x-y plane [0:23:39]
 and hit okay. I'm going to sketch the hole by a one. Well this is going to be the whole structure [0:23:48]
 because we're going to go for a pad first just with a circle and we can set the diameter in a minute. [0:23:55]
 That's hit close. So at the moment our hole that we want on this surface is sitting here. [0:24:02]
 If we look at that sketch and one going to do is just rename that. So this is whole feature. [0:24:09]
 If we look down at the data tab and look at the map mode at the moment it's flat face and [0:24:19]
 the sport is x-y plane. Now if I click in that map mode field there we get the button. [0:24:26]
 Click on the button. At the moment it's on that plane x-y. We want to use [0:24:33]
 our scaffolding this geometry here to place this in line with this edge. To do that let's [0:24:41]
 click on plane so it's saying select in. So this is the first reference and let's let [0:24:48]
 this vertex closest to the face. The sketch has moved. As you can see it's sitting there but it's [0:24:59]
 around the wrong way. This is where reference 2 comes into play. Click reference 2 and this time [0:25:05]
 select the edge. Nothing has happened because we have got the wrong attachment mode. We come down. [0:25:13]
 What we're looking at is normal to edge. So click normal to edge you see the sketch has been placed. [0:25:21]
 Actually within that face. I'll hit OK and I'll go and click on the whole feature and just change [0:25:33]
 that now. So it's in place. I'm going to use the section view sketch view section. [0:25:40]
 And we can see it's actually inside that's no problems. I'm just going to change that size of [0:25:49]
 that to get to the right size and set centimeter of 7mm. Let's close that. [0:26:05]
 So that's sitting in there. What we can do if it's around the wrong way is that I can [0:26:11]
 select that sketch and look at the remap reverse and set that to true. For double click on that [0:26:18]
 hole now it's now around the other way so you can see it's around this way instead. [0:26:24]
 Let's close that. A better option. Let's just set that back to matte reverse's force. [0:26:33]
 Is to use the lines the other vertex. So let's come into that whole feature. [0:26:39]
 Coming to the matte mode and we're going to use a third reference. So reference free. We click on that. [0:26:47]
 Make sure it's saying selecting and select the top vertex. We get the attachment mode already selected. [0:26:55]
 So what's happened is that we've used the vertex with placement, the bottom vertex, [0:27:02]
 the line to line the normal to the normal for sketch and the top vertex. So it's pointing upwards. [0:27:09]
 When we okay that and then take that whole feature and use a pad, it'll pad in the correct direction. [0:27:20]
 One thing to note if we zoom in is to note that there may be some gaping around here. If there [0:27:30]
 is we can change the type from dimension to two dimensions. So I'm going to go up a length of two [0:27:37]
 and what we can do with this one is sense length downwards as well. So we change this to [0:27:45]
 say a millimeter and that goes into the material. We hit okay we get our feature. [0:27:56]
 And we can sketch upon here for instance I can take this face and this is a planner face now [0:28:03]
 because it's just a standard pad. Let's set that top and create a sketch. I'm going to bring in some geometry. [0:28:11]
 So I get the center point and what we can do is just add a circle in the center and close [0:28:20]
 and pop it that through and that'll come out the other side like so. That's it okay. [0:28:31]
 And we just repeat for the others. So for instance let's take this one make sure nothing's [0:28:37]
 selected create a sketch x y plane or whatever plane you want and this time let's go for [0:28:44]
 something different. Let's go for a hexagon. Let me replace a hexagon style hole in there. [0:28:52]
 And we're not going to use this constraint just to pull that in close to that and we'll take that sketch [0:28:59]
 and change the map mode and moment of that face. Selecting first one we need to come in and select [0:29:10]
 the vertex. If you have trouble selecting the vertex of this sketch it's cancelled out. [0:29:14]
 Select the sketch that's got the scaffolding this one. We'll just select it from the screen. [0:29:20]
 You'll highlight in the left hand pane. Come down to view and then come down to the object style [0:29:29]
 and you want your find is a point size and we can up that point size of up to eight and it [0:29:36]
 might be easier once selecting those vertices. So now we can select that sketch come back to the [0:29:42]
 data and you can see the sketch has been selected here. Map mode come in. First button select in for the [0:29:54]
 first reference and we just zoom in and pick the vertex that places our sketch in position. [0:30:03]
 Next we do with the rotation by selecting the second reference, [0:30:07]
 starting the line. Make sure it's normal to edge and then that's let reference free [0:30:14]
 and select the top vertex and here okay. Make sure after we just select the sketch and then we pad. [0:30:26]
 You can see what's happened here is disappeared and that's because we got some gap in. [0:30:32]
 If we select reverse you can see it's going into the material. I don't want that so I'll [0:30:40]
 select this down to two dimensions and you can see because it's gone down the second length [0:30:45]
 of 10mm it's created one continuous body which is required for the part design. [0:30:52]
 We're just going to change this to one millimeter and set this to two mil. [0:30:59]
 So this is what I was saying about the gaping you have to be careful with this because [0:31:05]
 it will make your model disappear and if I remove this gaping to zero or just like this as [0:31:14]
 dimension and here okay we get pad results has multiple solids this is not supported at its time [0:31:21]
 and if we're lucky we should be able to see the gaping under there but unfortunately we can't [0:31:31]
 really because of the curvature but we notice there because when we go to two dimensions [0:31:37]
 and set the second length as one millimeter and here okay [0:31:43]
 we're all fine. Obviously we don't need to do the pad we could do say a pocket [0:31:55]
 and we don't have to worry about gaping because even if the sketch was up here we pocketed [0:32:04]
 down enough or just go through all then that's taking that feature all the way through [0:32:09]
 and that pocket is valid. That's it okay and it's the same with any other features on here [0:32:21]
 for instance if we wanted to do some features along here then we would use the center of this arc here [0:32:30]
 so the arc center which is just here and we'll place lines across coming out and attach [0:32:38]
 those features onto here. We can finish this off by selecting all the features [0:32:46]
 so I want to mirror this across so this will be all of the features that make up this so if I press [0:32:54]
 the spacebar on the pad you notice everything is made invisible and we can go through the individual [0:33:03]
 stages by pressing the spacebar on each to make them visible and these make up our model. [0:33:10]
 So if I wanted to mirror this in the part design or to each of the features control click them [0:33:19]
 and then use the mirror or part design fly pattern and mirror it. That mirrors those [0:33:32]
 features across and you can see them being added here so we've got the pads attractive pipe [0:33:37]
 etc. It's going to cross the vertical axis. That's the right axis. Okay and we've got our finished part [0:33:54]
 so I hope that's helped you create features on non-planet surfaces. Obviously we don't have to [0:33:59]
 constrain to the center of the arc if we got an arc or even a beast line that has got some more [0:34:05]
 curvature then we can use the lines again even if they're not connected to the center. It's just [0:34:11]
 got a line on that face in the right direction to allow for that feature to be added. I hope you enjoy [0:34:17]
