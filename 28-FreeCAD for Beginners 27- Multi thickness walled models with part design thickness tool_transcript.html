===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD for Beginners 27- Multi thickness walled models with part design thickness tool =====
 Hi everyone and welcome to the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning [0:00:03]
 Free Cafe for Beginners teaching fundamentals of free cat whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:07]
 Today we're going to be looking at the thickness tool. [0:00:10]
 We're going to start with how to use the thickness tool and how to hold out such an object as this. [0:00:15]
 We've just a few clicks on the mouse button. [0:00:18]
 We're going to be understanding how to add variable thickness such as the base of this box. [0:00:23]
 A little trick that I'm going to show you how to achieve that. [0:00:25]
 We're then going to look at more complex shapes. [0:00:28]
 And how the hole in works. [0:00:31]
 We're such a shape like this. [0:00:34]
 We're then going to turn to a little project where we're going to use what we learned to create a very simple [0:00:39]
 lit and box with tolerances to allow the lit to fit on here snugly. [0:00:45]
 And we can see the cap and we're going there. [0:00:49]
 This will be done with one sketch only. [0:00:52]
 And I'm going to show you a trick with shape binders and thicknesses to achieve the angle. [0:00:58]
 So I hope you enjoy this channel and let's have a look at this workflow. [0:01:01]

 For this demonstration I'm in the part design. [0:01:28]
 I'm going to create a new body and a new sketch. [0:01:32]
 We're going to go along the x-y plane and hit OK. [0:01:35]
 So we're looking down on the object. [0:01:37]
 We're going to just sketch a simple rectangle in here to show the thickness features. [0:01:45]
 Not going to bother about constraints just going to close it. [0:01:47]
 And I'm going to add some height to this by using the pad. [0:01:52]
 So use a pad on that sketch and set it to 20mm. [0:01:56]
 Now the thickness tool lives on the tool bar just here. [0:02:00]
 Fickness make a fix solid and also it's at one more part design. [0:02:04]
 Apply a dress up and add thickness. [0:02:08]
 What the thickness actually does if we use the top face here if the pad [0:02:13]
 and apply that thickness, [0:02:14]
 our solid is hollowed out. [0:02:18]
 Given the same width walls all the way around. [0:02:21]
 We'll look at the thickness is set to one more meter at the moment and this can change the say 5mm. [0:02:27]
 You notice that this is gone outwards so the thickness has gone this way. [0:02:31]
 And it has curved edges. [0:02:34]
 We can change that with the join type. [0:02:38]
 So you can see all those curved edges all the way around there. [0:02:41]
 So the join type to intersection and then we get straight edges all the way around. [0:02:48]
 Now if you want to inwards we just check the make thickness inwards. [0:02:54]
 That sends it inwards like so. [0:02:57]
 We don't have the option for an arc. [0:03:00]
 That goes inwards. [0:03:02]
 It's the same as basically an intersection. [0:03:05]
 One thing to note is that all these walls, [0:03:10]
 including the bottom face here, [0:03:12]
 will be the same thickness. [0:03:14]
 If I OK that and section view through the material, [0:03:19]
 I'll come in at the view, put it down to clip and plane. [0:03:22]
 And we're going to clip it along this plane here. [0:03:27]
 So I'll enter the section it through the center. [0:03:30]
 And this is going to be going this way. [0:03:32]
 So this will be the x plane. [0:03:34]
 So clip in and plane x. [0:03:36]
 We can see that's clicked in there and you can see that thickness of that wall is the same size. [0:03:42]
 This can cause problems. [0:03:44]
 So if I bring back the clip and plane here close, [0:03:50]
 that's how I look at what we might want to do if the thickness is say two millimeters. [0:03:59]
 So we've got two millimeters wall, [0:04:02]
 but we have a two millimeter wall here. [0:04:05]
 What we're also going to do is remove one of these faces as well. [0:04:10]
 So I'm going to add face again and click on this face. [0:04:14]
 Nothing looks like it's happened, but let's just toggle the make thickness inwards on and off. [0:04:20]
 So it refreshes and you can see that face has been removed. [0:04:23]
 And you can see the thickness of these walls are the same. [0:04:26]
 So if we want to do a thicker bottom, what do we do? [0:04:30]
 What is quite simple? [0:04:31]
 Because this is a plan of shape, [0:04:34]
 we can take that bottom face and just pad it. [0:04:39]
 We don't need a sketch. [0:04:41]
 If we pad that, you can see we can make the thickness that we need. [0:04:45]
 So I'm going to add, [0:04:47]
 play two millimeter thickness onto the base and hit OK. [0:04:50]
 Therefore, we have a thicker base and thinner sides. [0:04:56]
 If we're placing any features upon here, we may not want these two faces here. [0:05:03]
 We might want to merge them into one. [0:05:04]
 And we can easily do that by clicking on the pad. [0:05:07]
 Coming down to the refine and setting this to true. [0:05:12]
 What this does, it removes that face that is planar with this section. [0:05:18]
 And it seems that it's an unneeded face, so it's just merged into one face there. [0:05:24]
 Just remember that if we've got this here, [0:05:28]
 if we turn that back on or set to force, [0:05:33]
 then our underlining edges and naming of the edges will change. [0:05:39]
 This is not a problem of free CAD, this is not a topological naming issue. [0:05:44]
 With such packages like Fusion 360, [0:05:46]
 you'll find that if you have anything added to say, [0:05:50]
 reference in one of these edges, this one here. [0:05:53]
 And create a feature that reference that edge, [0:05:55]
 when that edge disappears, the feature will be highlighted in yellow. [0:05:59]
 That shows that the underlining geometry or face has disappeared [0:06:04]
 and is no longer available. [0:06:07]
 You have to go back through the tree to re-ad that. [0:06:09]
 Now what happens if we add the thickness to a more complex shape? [0:06:14]
 So that's to look at some art shapes to show you the same kind of thing happens. [0:06:20]
 So create a body, create a sketch. [0:06:21]
 We're going to go along this time, the X-ed plane, okay that. [0:06:26]
 And I'm going to create a long constraint sketch, [0:06:30]
 or say an arc, we're going to both about the constraints, [0:06:33]
 and we'll create a straight line across those. [0:06:38]
 Now we'll look at this, if we add it, [0:06:43]
 selects the sketch and put it by say 30 millimeters, we get the shape, [0:06:49]
 and we can do the same, we can select the top, [0:06:51]
 and use the thickness and create a thickness in here. [0:06:55]
 You can see the thickness has gone outwards, [0:06:57]
 and we can make the thickness inwards. [0:07:00]
 Now one thing to note is that the trick of using say this, put them face and pattern it, [0:07:08]
 is going to still work, so you can see that's been padded straight upwards there. [0:07:13]
 And we set that to something like two millimeters. [0:07:17]
 But we're going to get these tops here, so we've got these here, [0:07:23]
 so we have to deal with those. [0:07:25]
 So that's okay that. [0:07:28]
 So we've got this face here, [0:07:31]
 which we need to either do a cut or remove somehow. [0:07:37]
 We could select that face and do a pocket and go through all, [0:07:41]
 and that will quickly remove that and the same for the other side. [0:07:45]
 So let's cancel that and select both of them. [0:07:51]
 Control selecting both the faces, [0:07:55]
 and doing a pocket, [0:08:01]
 through all and that takes that away. [0:08:06]
 That's okay that, as you can see we've got multiple faces, [0:08:11]
 we can refine that, we want, so that's true. [0:08:16]
 There are moves those, but notice the thickness, we have a variation of thickness [0:08:23]
 here compared here. [0:08:25]
 Let's do the section for you, got to view, clip and plane, [0:08:31]
 and we'll look along the Y, and we can see what's happened inside. [0:08:37]
 So you can see the variation of thickness in there, [0:08:42]
 and let's go along the X as well. [0:08:46]
 Personally, if I was making this shape and I wanted to hold it out, [0:08:52]
 I would use some other approach by using multiple geometry. [0:08:56]
 For instance, I'll sketch coming up on these two, [0:09:00]
 and then create this shape and then add the sides onto it. [0:09:04]
 Therefore, I'll go total control over the edge thickness. [0:09:07]
 That's closed, that clip and plane, [0:09:12]
 and remove the objects within and keep in the sketch. [0:09:18]
 I'm going to pad this, 12-20mm, [0:09:22]
 and I'm going to do something different now, so I'm going to create a sketch upon here. [0:09:27]
 So new sketch and we're creating a sketch, that's it. [0:09:32]
 Something like this, that's it closed, and we'll pocket this, [0:09:37]
 about two millimeters, so we have this shape. [0:09:40]
 Now we can't add a thickness to this face, [0:09:45]
 so I click on that face and add a thickness, [0:09:49]
 it's going to fail, so you can see it's got a failure there. [0:09:52]
 Because the thickness is applied to all the faces we've in here, [0:09:55]
 so it makes all these faces thick. [0:09:57]
 What you can do if I cancel that, [0:10:00]
 is add a sketch on here, [0:10:03]
 create new sketch, and we'll create a sketch within. [0:10:09]
 Like so, and this demonstrates what's happens. [0:10:14]
 That's pad this slightly, by 0.1mm, [0:10:19]
 so we've created a small pad if I select top face and create a thickness. [0:10:26]
 You see the thickness has gone outwards, [0:10:29]
 so we're actually increasing the thickness of the model now. [0:10:34]
 Until it goes into error, now if you look, [0:10:39]
 because we've got the arc, selected for the join type, [0:10:43]
 when these arcs start crossing over, [0:10:45]
 it'll go into error, like so. [0:10:49]
 That's just take that off, in place it's intersection. [0:10:54]
 As you can see, it's not working, but if we go make thickness inwards, [0:11:02]
 we can see what's happening inside. [0:11:05]
 And set it to onemm, later. [0:11:10]
 So we're looking to side what's happened is that the material has been removed, [0:11:17]
 and it's showing out the object from inside. [0:11:21]
 When we go over to the cross section, [0:11:25]
 view, clip and plane, [0:11:29]
 and use our X and Y, [0:11:32]
 we can see what's happening inside here. [0:11:35]
 So you get this removal of material [0:11:39]
 and leaving all the walls the same thickness. [0:11:43]
 So one of the things that I use thickness for is to create quick enclosures. [0:11:47]
 Now the technique I'm going to show is using the shape binder as well, [0:11:50]
 and I'm going to just use one single sketch to create both the main box [0:11:55]
 and the lid, and the lid is going to have tolerance as well. [0:11:59]
 So we're going to create a body, and we're going to create a sketch [0:12:03]
 along the X Y plane and OK that. [0:12:07]
 Now I'm going to come in and create a rectangle. [0:12:12]
 I'm going to use the curvature of the roundy rectangle just for a bit more detail. [0:12:20]
 So we've got that one there. [0:12:24]
 I'm not going to worry about constraints, [0:12:27]
 which is going to move quickly through this. [0:12:29]
 So I've got the rectangle, I'll select it at the sketch. [0:12:32]
 I can pad this now. [0:12:33]
 And we're pad this by 20 mil. [0:12:36]
 We add the thickness by coming into the top and add in the thickness. [0:12:42]
 And we send the thickness inwards. [0:12:48]
 And I'm going to create the sides at 2mm, but I want to thicker base as well. [0:12:55]
 That's just OK that. [0:12:56]
 Come round, select the base and set the thickness of the base. [0:13:01]
 By using a pad. [0:13:04]
 And we're going to pad that by 2 mil. [0:13:07]
 So now we've got a 4mm thickness on the base [0:13:11]
 and a 2mm thickness on the walls. [0:13:15]
 So I've created basically the box, the bottom of the box, [0:13:20]
 to create the top, I'm going to bring in a shape binder. [0:13:23]
 For that, I need something to attach it to. [0:13:25]
 Now if we go back to the original pad, [0:13:28]
 this one here in press the space bar. [0:13:30]
 We see the top of the box. [0:13:32]
 And this is what I'm going to use the shape binder. [0:13:35]
 And this is how I'm going to add tolerance as well. [0:13:38]
 So before I add the binder, that's create a new body. [0:13:43]
 If we look at this body, you can see it's bold and it's active. [0:13:48]
 And that's what we want. [0:13:49]
 That's the span, our first body. [0:13:53]
 So we can get to the top pad. [0:13:55]
 So this one here. [0:13:56]
 And we select just the top face that pad. [0:14:01]
 Now when we add the substrate binder, what will happen is it will be placed inside this [0:14:05]
 body, but it will be linked to the face of this pad. [0:14:07]
 So go to part design and create a substrate binder. [0:14:12]
 You'll see the binder is in the second body. [0:14:15]
 Now if binders, you normally use some for reference, but you can pad them as well. [0:14:21]
 So this is perfect for making our lid. [0:14:23]
 That's hide the original body and click on the substrate binder. [0:14:31]
 I'll actually bring it around to the bottom and pad downwards. [0:14:35]
 So we're going to hit pad. [0:14:37]
 This will pad upwards as it reverse and it will send it downwards. [0:14:42]
 We go length of 10mm and okay. [0:14:46]
 That's coming. [0:14:48]
 Select the bottom. [0:14:50]
 Remember our body. [0:14:52]
 So this one here sits on the bottom here. [0:14:55]
 So I'm going to come into that pad. [0:14:59]
 That's hide the bottom and select the bottom of our lid. [0:15:04]
 And use a thickness. [0:15:07]
 This time I'm going to send it downwards. [0:15:09]
 Last thickness we went inwards, the next thickness we're going outwards. [0:15:13]
 And I set the thickness to two millimeters, [0:15:18]
 hours. [0:15:19]
 Like so. [0:15:20]
 And maybe I want to thicker top, but we'll go for that in the moment. [0:15:26]
 That's okay that. [0:15:28]
 So the moment what we've got is the original body. [0:15:32]
 This one here that's show that pad and it sits inside that lid. [0:15:39]
 But we don't have any tolerances yet. [0:15:42]
 So we're trying to free to print this. [0:15:44]
 This one actually fit on top because we got a tight tolerance here. [0:15:48]
 Unless we forced it on there. [0:15:50]
 So how do we solve that? [0:15:51]
 Well the substrate binder has an offset. [0:15:54]
 Let's find that binder. [0:15:56]
 This one here and come down to the data tab. [0:15:59]
 Come right down to the bottom and you'll see the offset. [0:16:03]
 And set this offset to one. [0:16:07]
 So one millimeter and it will push it outwards and you can see we've got gaping in here now. [0:16:12]
 So you can see it all in there and the gaping is within. [0:16:16]
 So we can play with this and say 0.5 or 0.25. [0:16:24]
 And that gives us our tolerance. [0:16:27]
 So we've made a quick and simple box. [0:16:31]
 Using thickness going inwards and a thickness going outwards and using the substrate binder [0:16:37]
 to give us a tolerance. [0:16:39]
 So that's it for this video. [0:16:41]
