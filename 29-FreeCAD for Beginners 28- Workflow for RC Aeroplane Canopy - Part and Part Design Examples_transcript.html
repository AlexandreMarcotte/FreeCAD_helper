===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD for Beginners 28- Workflow for RC Aeroplane Canopy - Part and Part Design Examples =====
 I've used them all for the channel and today we're going to be looking at creating [0:00:04]
 a canopy such as this in free CAD in both the part and the part design workbench. [0:00:10]
 This opens the door to more complex forms which we'll be looking at in future videos. [0:00:15]
 So I hope you're enjoying this series. Let's have a look at this technique. [0:00:18]
 4-M-A-N-G-Z-R. Also run a Patreon, where you can subscribe and get extra content. [0:00:36]
 And that's at www.patreon.com, 4-Mango Jelly Solutions. [0:00:40]
 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to spend the channel. [0:00:44]
 So for this surface in tutorial we're going to be using the part and then we're going to go into [0:00:48]
 the part design afterwards to show you how the two workflows actually are basically exactly the same. [0:00:54]
 So we're going to be modeling this airplane canopy. [0:00:57]
 And what we're looking for is an initial shape of this. I'm not worried about the dimensions [0:01:04]
 because there is no dimensions in here. I can go in and measure it but this is just from [0:01:10]
 Grab CAD and here's the URL for the actual model. [0:01:15]
 And I'm just going to be using this as reference. So what I'm looking at is the profile [0:01:21]
 from the different angles. So we're looking at the footprint. [0:01:25]
 And then we're going to be looking at the profile [0:01:32]
 from the different angles like so. It's not going to be a sack replica. [0:01:38]
 This is just to get the technique down of how you attack or something like this. [0:01:42]
 So we're going to start with the footprint. And we're going to make a number of scaffolding sketches. [0:01:47]
 The first one I'm going to do along the XY plane for the footprint. [0:01:52]
 Let's take a closer look at the model. So if we're bringing the model around [0:01:57]
 we can see we've got these overhangs here. And if we look at the bottom we can see the footprint [0:02:06]
 is this part and this part may go out this way. So we have to take notice of these overhangs. [0:02:14]
 I'm going to create a line and we're going to mirror this model over the other side as well. [0:02:22]
 So we're just doing one side because there can be a symmetrical. We can get away [0:02:26]
 of doing one side and then mirroring that over to the other. Remember this is not a Zapt replica. [0:02:32]
 We don't know any measurements either but if I did know I would be placing some length between [0:02:40]
 these points here and we just put some odd per tree lengthening for the time being. [0:02:48]
 Something like that. It's not fully constrained but we go for that for the time being. [0:02:58]
 Let's close that so that's one side of the footprint. [0:03:03]
 We're now going to create another sketch to line the profiles and this is quite important. [0:03:10]
 So new sketch make sure nothing's selected. New sketch x y plane. [0:03:19]
 Look at beginning and end of this line. We're going to be using the point which is not often used [0:03:27]
 and we're going to place these in line at different points for the profile. So we've got one here, [0:03:36]
 one bat and middle and another one and one at the end. These can be set a distance away. [0:03:44]
 And what we're going to do is use these points to line this line and the top curve of the canopy. [0:03:54]
 So for instance I may want to come in here and add say a length between these two [0:04:00]
 and set them a certain length away. Making sure we select the right ones. [0:04:07]
 Say 30, etc. [0:04:12]
 This one is going to be a bit less so we have those down. Not sure what length these are but we'll go for that [0:04:22]
 for the time being. That's close that at the moment you can see that we can't see those points. [0:04:31]
 That's because when the points are added they're automatically converted to construction geometry. [0:04:37]
 We need the set bows to be out of construction mode. Therefore when I close we can see the points. [0:04:44]
 For coming to this sketch now, this one here we can pull in those points [0:04:51]
 and the line lines with those, like so. And we'll do the end one as well. [0:05:03]
 So use the Stenor geometry and pull in that point. This is important to keep everything in line [0:05:10]
 because what we're going to do is we're going to add some points to this line as well. So let's [0:05:18]
 pull in the other points. So this one and if we look there's no more of my add another [0:05:29]
 to in here go for that for the time being and also going to add points to this line. [0:05:37]
 Now depending on what type of line you're using it if you're using be splined you'll have to do [0:05:42]
 some in difference so we use a be splined in the next one for the top canopy. [0:05:46]
 Rather than an arc or something like that. Now I've got bows in there. One going to do is use [0:05:53]
 the vertical constraint and line those points, like so. [0:05:59]
 Let's make sure that the points are converted to construction geometry [0:06:07]
 and head close. So you can see we've got these points in here and now we've got points on this line. [0:06:15]
 The reason why we added them is because if you add a profile across here these points will [0:06:22]
 sharpen the profile when you import them in. If we didn't have these points or some kind of [0:06:27]
 divide in this line we could divide this into edges then the only points we have to pull in are the [0:06:34]
 endpoints and they will be no good to attach our profiles too. So we have this lining here that's [0:06:42]
 add the top profile. So let's get ourselves orientated to the front and add the sketch [0:06:54]
 long the X Z plane. This is actually the side profile. That's okay that. So we're here now. [0:07:07]
 Let's take a look and what we've got. So we can see the curvature of the top is here and we're [0:07:16]
 using a B-spline. Now the same again is we pull in these points and these points [0:07:25]
 need to be on our B-spline as well. If I was doing this to scale what would be doing is measuring [0:07:32]
 from here to here at different sections and then I can place a height between those points [0:07:38]
 and then draw the B-spline between those. Now one thing we must remember is that we can't add [0:07:44]
 a single B-spline in here because we'll happen we add in the points here to scale. These [0:07:51]
 points won't show up. These points will and we can't add points to this line. They will not attach [0:08:01]
 onto that line. So we have to find enough a method. We can use the B-spline and what we do [0:08:09]
 is I know that when we look at the model we can see the starting point is here. So this is the [0:08:17]
 point of origin states here and it's over this way and angle from there. So I'm going to come up [0:08:22]
 at an angle and place one point here. So this will show up. This one won't and this one will [0:08:31]
 if I hit a scape. So we have to build this in this way. So this point here will be in line with this one. [0:08:38]
 And add the vertical constraint. Click the B-spline again and we're going to go [0:08:51]
 quinstant to that point. We've got the autoconstraints on and I've checked the auto [0:08:56]
 removed redundant constraints as well. Probably won't need it for this one. Click [0:09:01]
 and the third point needs to be in line with this one and place those in line and continue. [0:09:10]
 And that one's in line. And again this goes further this way. So we go for the B-spline [0:09:26]
 finish. We could add some construction geometry in here like so. Turn this to construction [0:09:40]
 and set an angle between these two if we wanted to. If we want to find out the angle [0:09:46]
 I watch that lies. But I'm quite happy with what we got there. Let's close that. [0:09:55]
 So we've got the footprint and the top curve. Which is also the side profile. So this is the top curve. [0:10:06]
 This one is the footprint and this one is the point which is just there to help us. [0:10:24]
 So this is the placement sketch. Now we've got those. What we can do is highlight all [0:10:40]
 free sketches and come down to the view and I'm just going to up the point site. This makes it [0:10:46]
 a lot easier to see those vertices and we just up it to six point size. So we can see those [0:10:54]
 there just make it a lot easier to select. If you want to as well you can come in and say change [0:11:01]
 the color as well so line color we can change the footprint so red. So you know where about [0:11:10]
 some of this in free space. The idea of these points are to place a profile along. So the first [0:11:19]
 profile will be this one but I'm going to go for this one to start with. Crits sketch and we need to [0:11:28]
 position it along the same plane so I can't saw that because we're going to translate the origin [0:11:35]
 of this. So we're going to place it along the Y's airplane. Make sure nothing's selected new sketch. [0:11:41]
 Y said and we look at this I'm going to make this reverse and hit OK. So that's in position now [0:11:50]
 and I'm just going to draw a simple rectangle in there just getting idea of where that lays. [0:11:58]
 Now if we look we can see the points here and here of this curve. So if this rectangle was placed [0:12:10]
 on this point we'll have this point and this point and we can place our arcs in here to make the [0:12:18]
 curvature of the canopy and make sure they join up with these points. Let's close that and we've got [0:12:27]
 our first rectangle in. Now with all the other rectangles this is just temporary by the way just to [0:12:35]
 show you where this lays with all the other profile sketches and the rectangles in there. [0:12:40]
 We just need copy this sketch at it. Copy and then edit paste or control v. [0:12:50]
 That copy is that sketch. Come down to the map mode what we need to do is coming here and [0:12:57]
 click on the button at the end or what I have to do now is select the vertex I wanted to place still. [0:13:04]
 You can see it's got translate origin. So the origin was here and it's just translated across [0:13:12]
 and because that sketch is still in memory, troll v and it's there. Now one tip I'll give you here [0:13:23]
 let me just delete those two and rename this sketch to profile one. Is that when I copy this? [0:13:33]
 troll c and troll v then I'll get profile two to the name in is correct and now we can use the map mode. [0:13:41]
 And select paste another one. Use the map mode for our last profile. [0:13:54]
 Well this is next to the last. That's okay that. That's hide those profiles. [0:14:03]
 We need a profile here so we're going to use a different map mode here because [0:14:11]
 we need to align it going this way but I angle to intercept this point. [0:14:18]
 For that I'm going to come up to the top view and add another sketch. [0:14:26]
 X Y plane. Bring the sketch to the side. I want to import this point. [0:14:35]
 And I might do the same with this point but that should be enough and now I'm going to place [0:14:44]
 a line goes across and that's symmetrical so taking these two points and this point in the middle [0:14:53]
 and using symmetry. So we've got a line here. That's close that. [0:15:00]
 So we have this line so this is going to be a scaffolding sketch that we're going to use to position the next sketch. [0:15:09]
 Let's take a copy of one of those profiles. [0:15:14]
 Troules c. At the moment it's attached so I'm going to take away the placement sketch just leave the profile [0:15:23]
 zero zero three okay and control the show that sketch. Come down to the map mode. At the moment [0:15:35]
 it's translate. Let's click on that and we just can click on the vertex so it says selecting. [0:15:41]
 So this time I'm going to select the line. At the moment the set is normal to edge. I'm going to go [0:15:50]
 in the next two three. Now I'm going to go for reference two and I'm going to select this point. [0:15:56]
 We're now aligned between these two points and this line. [0:16:08]
 Let's okay that and now our profile and map mode three points on plane and we're ready to go. [0:16:22]
 Let's start sketching with this one. [0:16:25]
 I'll click the profile and I'm going to make a wall to profile in here. [0:16:36]
 So I'm going to create closed geometry to do this. I don't need this rectangle anymore. [0:16:43]
 That's just the show where that sketch was in three these ways. One need to do is bring in [0:16:49]
 these two points. So this point and this point and this is the reason why we added these points. [0:16:56]
 Because if we got the points in there we can then just add. I'm using the end point and [0:17:02]
 room point arc. You can use a beast line if you want. We can just add an arc in here [0:17:12]
 and we'll add another one to make the inner wall. We need to line to connect them up. [0:17:19]
 Remember we got the auto constraints and the auto removal for a done at constraints [0:17:26]
 and we'll create a line in here as well. Make sure that's straight [0:17:33]
 and set's in distance 1.5 millimeters [0:17:39]
 Make the two equal and we'll set the radius of these to be equal as well. [0:17:53]
 We can change these to the curvature that we want but I'm just going to go for something like that. [0:18:03]
 Hit close we can see that the curvature [0:18:08]
 aligns with the top and the sides. We can hide that profile and work on our next one. [0:18:20]
 Which is profile 1 this one here. Double click and it's basically the same process. [0:18:28]
 I'll bring in the points. Add in the first arc. [0:18:36]
 And the second. [0:18:45]
 Close in the geometry. [0:18:53]
 Making sure it is closed. [0:19:00]
 And then once the geometry is closed we can start adding our constraints. [0:19:11]
 If you wanted to set up a parameter for such things as this width [0:19:20]
 and we add the equality constraints [0:19:27]
 and then the radius constraints or length constraints at the one. [0:19:35]
 So we have two profiles so far. We're going to do sketching the upper profiles [0:19:45]
 and then we can move on to the next step. [0:19:48]
 We've got one last profile to add. That's this one here. [0:19:53]
 Again this is the same as this one here. How this is set up. [0:19:59]
 Remember we created a line and attached sketch to the line and reference this point. [0:20:08]
 Let's do that on the other side. I'm going to create another line. [0:20:12]
 We can do it on the same sketch. I'm just going to create another one. [0:20:18]
 And we'll place in line with this point. [0:20:26]
 Just line in there. [0:20:32]
 Making sure that these two points are symmetrical to that point. [0:20:38]
 Let's close that. [0:20:44]
 And now we come around to the Zyplane. [0:20:49]
 And create new sketch. [0:20:52]
 Why Z? Or Zyplane? Okay that. [0:20:58]
 That's it. It's a basic geometry so we can know [0:21:05]
 where the sketch is in 3D space. [0:21:07]
 And finally take that sketch. [0:21:10]
 Just going to be profile 5 and look at the map mode. [0:21:20]
 Coming to the map mode. And we're slept. The new line. [0:21:24]
 The Nursher 2-3. Making sure we've got the right sketch selected. [0:21:31]
 This one here. Next reference is already saying slept in. So we're slept. [0:21:37]
 This vertex. We have plain by 3. And we hit okay. [0:21:44]
 So this profile now is set up. And we can come in and start sketching. [0:21:52]
 So I'm going to use a section of view. A few section. [0:21:59]
 And you can see the points are set up in there. So all we need to do [0:22:08]
 and just take that out. I'm pulling the top points. [0:22:13]
 And looking for the side points but I can't find them. Let's have a look see what we got. [0:22:22]
 Come back in. [0:22:25]
 Let's have a look. So it's over here. [0:22:35]
 And I want to pull in this point here. [0:22:40]
 Just pulling the line that's fine. [0:22:47]
 Back to the view section. And now I can add the arc. [0:22:56]
 If one thing I'm going to do in this one. [0:23:00]
 That you might want to do for all the rest as well. And that's made sure that the top of this is tangent. [0:23:06]
 So that's add in another arc. [0:23:10]
 You can see we haven't got anything to lay this on. So I'm going to make sure [0:23:17]
 this is in line. Take these two points. [0:23:20]
 Can't let them up. And these two points. [0:23:24]
 Don't think that connected. So let's take these two. [0:23:30]
 And you're taking these two. [0:23:35]
 Sure that equal. And with these two it's going to hit E for equal. [0:23:42]
 And set a length in here of 1.5. [0:23:50]
 Now to make sure that this point here is tangent. [0:23:55]
 This is a fixed point. We'll place a line going across here. [0:24:01]
 And this line is along the horizontal. [0:24:06]
 We'll attach it to this point. We'll point. [0:24:10]
 I'll check constraint or point and line constraint. And take this arc. [0:24:14]
 This line I use the tangent C. [0:24:17]
 So an endpoint edge tangent C will apply it. So this is now tangent. [0:24:22]
 Make sure that this is construction geometry. [0:24:26]
 Because that's tangent now we should get a nice mirror. We won't get any [0:24:30]
 dipping in here. Let's do that on the other side. So let's find [0:24:36]
 this one. You can see how that dip's over and comes down. So this profile here. [0:24:43]
 Double click it and come round. [0:24:46]
 And what we'll do is place the line in here. [0:24:51]
 Making sure it's nice and horizontal. With horizontal constraint. [0:24:57]
 Using this point and this line point on object constraint. [0:25:01]
 And you can see the tangency there. There is no tangency. Make sure this [0:25:05]
 construction geometry. So then show up and use this line or this arc. [0:25:10]
 And this one. And make them tangent. [0:25:13]
 And see how they move. [0:25:15]
 And we can go through and do that for them. But I'm not going to do it for these two. [0:25:25]
 Because we can see in the mirror what that looks like when it's mirrored over. [0:25:29]
 So we have our profiles. We have our footprints. Now we can go through the loft process. [0:25:36]
 I'm going to come over to the part workbench. [0:25:40]
 And we're going to create a new loft so part loft. [0:25:44]
 We've got our profiles when I click on them. Let me show up in green. [0:25:50]
 You can see them there. So we find our first profile which is not profile one. [0:25:55]
 Let's go forward this end. That's my which end we go for. So profile five. [0:25:59]
 Next profile is free this one. Next profile two. [0:26:06]
 One and last one four. Make sure great solid is checked and here. Okay. [0:26:15]
 Now we've got our loft. And we can see how closely that follows that line there. [0:26:24]
 Let's go for the mirror. So click on the loft. [0:26:30]
 Got to part mirroring. [0:26:34]
 We want to mirror this over. This point here, the z and the x. So the x-z plane. [0:26:43]
 So we'll pick that from here. Exet. Okay. And we've got our mirror. [0:26:49]
 Now if we look we can see what a nice tangent is here. [0:26:53]
 And as we go over the top. [0:26:56]
 You can see that some of the areas aren't tangent but we've got a nice mirror anyway. [0:27:03]
 We can come in and do that technique with tangent c. [0:27:06]
 Across the area if we want to put a surface. [0:27:09]
 And all we need to do is take the sketch here and hide them. [0:27:13]
 Coming to the loft and hide all the profiles. [0:27:18]
 Just let him in press and spacebar. [0:27:21]
 And there we have a finished canopy. [0:27:25]
 Now this point is worth looking over the model and seeing if we got some problems. [0:27:30]
 So it's worth looking at the corners here. So this corner is okay. [0:27:34]
 And if we come into this corner we can see we've got a problem in here. [0:27:39]
 And this is because the profiles are on top of each other virtually. [0:27:42]
 If we come into that loft. So this loft here and come down. [0:27:48]
 And we can set the max degrees to free. That changes the loft there. So you can see that's not [0:27:56]
 taken effect. We can try a higher number. [0:27:58]
 See if we have any luck. [0:28:03]
 That's not working. What we can do is come into our line. [0:28:13]
 So remember we attach this to a line. So this line's here. [0:28:16]
 And this deals with the placement of this profile. [0:28:21]
 So we just move this away. [0:28:24]
 By coming into the placement. [0:28:27]
 Into the position. [0:28:29]
 And we want to move it along the x axis. So this position. So it's not attachment. [0:28:34]
 So this is global corner systems. [0:28:36]
 Trow out and you can see that's moved. [0:28:40]
 But we've got some curvature in here. So I've moved that forward. [0:28:44]
 But you can see what's happened there. We've got this curve in down. [0:28:49]
 So this is affected the profile. So that's coming to the profile that loft. [0:28:54]
 Come down and look to find out which profile that is. [0:28:59]
 And I'm just pressing the space bar until I find which one it is, which is profile five. [0:29:05]
 And that's how we look. So yeah, we can see that this is pulled down this way. [0:29:11]
 So we need to put just place horizontal constraint on that one and close that. [0:29:16]
 And what else do we need to do? So that's high that and bring back the profiles and the footprint. [0:29:24]
 So let's come up and look at the footprint. [0:29:27]
 Should be looking at this side really. [0:29:31]
 It's profile five. [0:29:38]
 So you can see how far down that it. So this is the reason why it's going down this way. [0:29:44]
 That's double click that profile. [0:29:48]
 And you can see that line there. So let's move this line. [0:29:53]
 You're rid of this one and move this up to be in line with this one. [0:29:59]
 So we've obviously attached it to the wrong line. So we're going to bring in this line here. [0:30:04]
 And attach it to that. [0:30:11]
 Quintzons to that one and close. [0:30:15]
 And bring back the other loft. [0:30:23]
 So we've got our finished canopy. [0:30:28]
 Now if it's too wide, we can come in as that footprint and change these lengths. [0:30:40]
 And if we think we'll reconfigure. [0:30:47]
 Same with the profiles. We can change those profiles. That's just a time that I find. Click on it. Press spacebar. [0:30:53]
 These are two separate objects at the moment, which can be combined together. [0:30:59]
 I click on one. Click on the other. [0:31:01]
 And doing a union, which is a Boolean union found in part, Boolean and union together. [0:31:11]
 Those two are now union together. So let's finish canopy. [0:31:17]
 But how would you do that in the part design? Well, it's very similar. [0:31:20]
 So I'm going to get to the point where I'm loft. [0:31:27]
 Let's give it a look at that. So we've got back to all our sketches and our profiles here. [0:31:34]
 And once we get to this point, we'll have to use a part design. [0:31:41]
 We'll have to float. We'll just part design. We'll create a body. [0:31:47]
 So we've got the body there and we'll highlight all these and drop them into the body so we can use them in there. [0:31:57]
 And we'll hide the scaffolding sketches. So these here. [0:32:05]
 So we just have the profiles. [0:32:09]
 Let's find our first profile. So let's take this one and then create an additive loft. [0:32:19]
 Let's go to the first profile. Add a section, select and it's basically the same. [0:32:28]
 So we're doing exactly the same here. Moving across those, I can show a press add section first. [0:32:36]
 And we've got all those in there. Let's hit OK and we've got the additive loft. [0:32:48]
 In the part design workflow, I've got a profile here that looks a bit off. [0:32:54]
 But we just close this profile up. No problems there. [0:32:57]
 So let's have a look which profile that could be. [0:33:07]
 So we can see that one's a different length there. This one here. [0:33:18]
 So let's just double click that one. And set a length in here. [0:33:24]
 It looks like we've already set a length but we haven't equal those. So this one and this one should be equal. [0:33:32]
 And close that. I split up. And to mirror, we just take the additive loft and use the mirroring [0:33:42]
 or plant design apply a pattern and mirror it and just mirrors over the correct plane there. [0:33:52]
 Here, OK. And now we're done. We can come in and just tie those profiles like so. [0:34:06]
 So there's a very simple canopy. We're going to be doing more on surface in [0:34:15]
 and using the surface workbench as well as a part and part design in future videos. [0:34:20]
 So we can make more complex surfaces. Hope you enjoyed watching that video. I hope to see you're [0:34:24]
