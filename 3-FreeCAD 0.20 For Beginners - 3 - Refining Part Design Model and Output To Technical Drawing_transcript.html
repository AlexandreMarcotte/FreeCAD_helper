===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 3 - Refining Part Design Model and Output To Technical Drawing =====
 I've used them welcome to the FreeCAD for Beginners series. [0:00:03]
 This is the third part of these FreeCAD videos and we're looking at learning FreeCAD from a beginner's perspective. [0:00:09]
 But at the same time learning how the individual workflow is working in FreeCAD [0:00:14]
 and how they can be utilized whilst we learn the fundamentals. [0:00:18]
 In a previous video we looked at workflow which included the part design and sketcher [0:00:24]
 for creating a part design object which we later output [0:00:28]
 to SDL format as a file. [0:00:31]
 In this video we're keeping with a part design workflow but we're going to look at refining [0:00:35]
 that part that we created. [0:00:37]
 Don't worry if you haven't created that part yet. [0:00:39]
 We're going to cover that in this video but we're going to be looking at different sketch [0:00:42]
 in technique in there which includes arcs and fillets. [0:00:46]
 We're going to learn how to preserve constraints. [0:00:48]
 This will reduce the amount of sketches that we have in our workflow. [0:00:52]
 Everything will be in one sketch for one of the planes. [0:00:56]
 Then we're going to switch to another plane and use a simple sketch upon there. [0:01:00]
 So we're going to be modeling also in two planes. [0:01:02]
 We're also going to introduce the symmetry constraint as well. [0:01:06]
 Finally, rather than helping to a SDL file for the file output, [0:01:11]
 we're going to be output into a technical drawing. [0:01:14]
 The betterment is to get us up a running in FreeCAD. [0:01:17]
 Once we finish the results will be a technical drawing and a part [0:01:21]
 to allow it to be recreated by a third party. [0:01:24]

 In the previous video we made this object using a part design workflow and [0:01:54]
 exported it to the iron nest still file. [0:01:55]
 We're going to look to the tree view and we can see the actions that built up this model. [0:02:02]
 So our last action is in a little green icon then under the tip. [0:02:06]
 Here's where this stops and this is visible. [0:02:09]
 Any time we can go back in time, press the space bar, [0:02:13]
 to have a look to see how the model was created so we can go all the way back [0:02:17]
 to the pad. [0:02:19]
 If we come into here and expand the cycle onto the pad, we can see the underlying sketch. [0:02:26]
 If I press the space bar again just to show that we can see that's seen under there. [0:02:32]
 If we look at the sketch we can see we've got 100 mAh, 530 mAh and we've got a single red [0:02:40]
 angle. Now if we look at the other sketch, [0:02:43]
 it's close out there and come into this pocket which creates the holes. [0:02:48]
 We can see we have a sketch for those holes. [0:02:51]
 Let's hide that pocket. You can see this sketch here and then we've got the outer sketch. [0:02:58]
 Let's look at simplifying this model. [0:03:01]
 Our fruits and purification will learn a bit more about outer sketch in freecat. [0:03:06]
 So for this build the pocket is going to be off balance so it is the fillet. [0:03:12]
 So we're removing these from our workflow. [0:03:16]
 Let's see how we can do that. So I'm going to close out [0:03:20]
 and create a new document. Again we're going to be using the part design workflow. [0:03:28]
 So part design. So click on that and we're going to create our first sketch. [0:03:32]
 First of all if you remember when you need to create a body, [0:03:35]
 so we look at tasks you can see create bodies here. [0:03:39]
 Come back over to model. We're going to use this icon here. [0:03:43]
 But what happens if we add a sketch before we add a body? [0:03:48]
 Let's try it. Add a sketch and then we click on the xy plane because we want to look down on the [0:03:56]
 object. We're going to six one plane for part of the object and then move to another in a moment. [0:04:01]
 So let's hit OK. Let's have a look at the model type and see what's happened. [0:04:07]
 A body has been created for us and a new sketch has been placed inside that body. [0:04:15]
 So let's start sketching. We're going to start with the rectangle tool. [0:04:20]
 This one here. We'll drop this down and have a center to rectangle. [0:04:24]
 Again if we come out to the task we can see the auto constraints under the edit controls here is checked [0:04:32]
 and that you've already redundant auto constraints are checked as well. [0:04:35]
 This means that when we hover over that center point you can see that we've got the rectangle [0:04:42]
 underneath the crosshairs plus a constraint there so that's same that unquinsant to that point. [0:04:48]
 And we've got point online constraint. Please match the constraints up here. [0:04:54]
 So we're going to hover over the center point and click once and drag this into position. [0:05:01]
 Now it's dragged into position. I'm going to hide our hit the right mass button or the escape key. [0:05:08]
 So it can add some dimensions. Let's add a length to the top. [0:05:13]
 With the horizontal length or horizontal distance constraint click once and now we can add [0:05:20]
 100 millimeters onto that length. Now let's do the same to this one. At the moment we'll [0:05:27]
 go to the left hand side and the self-message we've got one degree of freedom. [0:05:31]
 Meaning that we can move up and down so we can move in the vertical axis. So one degree in the vertical [0:05:40]
 axis. So let's log that down by clicking on this side and using the vertical constraint, [0:05:46]
 vertical distance. The seats can green so it's fully constrained and we'll set that to 50. [0:05:52]
 So 50 millimeters. When it's gone green we know we have a closed sketch and everything is constrained. [0:06:01]
 So I can't actually move this. You can still get fully constrained sketches that are not closed. [0:06:08]
 In this case we have a fully closed sketch. So when we pad this a hit close and we add a bit of angle [0:06:19]
 to the screen using our mouse pointer and holding down one of the shortcut keys depending on which [0:06:24]
 navigation message you've chosen. I've got the touch pad and I'm using the alt to rotate. [0:06:30]
 When we pad this sketch make sure it's selected. You'll see we'll get the normal pad so we can add a length [0:06:38]
 to the pad of 5 millimeters. Previous video we've selected the top face and added a sketch. [0:06:44]
 We're not going to do that in this one. What we're going to do is [0:06:48]
 miss that step and come into the pad and expand the pad and look back at the sketch. [0:06:55]
 At the moment it's hidden but if we double click it we enter the sketch. Now we're going to add [0:07:01]
 10 millimeter circles for the holes. So what happens if we add a sketch inside here? [0:07:07]
 That's a experiment. Let's first click on the circle and I'm going to add this circle anywhere inside here. [0:07:15]
 So let's add the circle to click once and pull this out. Make sure you don't touch any of these lines [0:07:22]
 because you can see we got a tangent or just constraints coming up and that will strain it to that [0:07:27]
 line. So just place it here. This is not fully constrained. Now you can see the outside has turned [0:07:34]
 a much parallel green. That means that it's constrained but the sketch is fully constrained. [0:07:40]
 Let's close out of here and see what happens. You can now see that we've got a hole just by this pad [0:07:47]
 without using any pockets. Let's go back. Let's move this outside. Let's move this outside now. [0:07:56]
 This is invalid because it's created multiple bodies. If I hit close now you can see that nothing has [0:08:04]
 look over to the left hand side. You'll see that we've got an exclamation mark on the pad. [0:08:10]
 That means it's in error and you can see down the bottom when we roll over that exclamation mark [0:08:16]
 or that pad result has multiple solids. This is not supported at this time. You may see this as a [0:08:22]
 pop-up. So for instance in the revolve view view panels revolve view you'll see a pop-up come up. [0:08:32]
 And if this happens you can turn this off by going to edit preferences and then turn it off [0:08:38]
 in the output window. So these here we can uncheck those. [0:08:43]
 To resolve this problem we can double click on the sketch and just move this back inside. [0:08:51]
 And that resolves this issue. Let's place this as holes inside this sketch. [0:08:58]
 We don't have to import any external geometry because we've got a geometry already here. [0:09:03]
 First thing I'm going to do is place the holes in this sketch. [0:09:09]
 So taking in the circle, click in once, pull the mount and just get a rough [0:09:14]
 dimension of the hole near enough in the correct place. So we click the right mass button [0:09:22]
 or hit escape to get the mouse pointed back. Now we can add some dimensions to these. [0:09:27]
 I'm going to click all of them just by clicking once and I'll select all of them. [0:09:32]
 If we accidentally say select this line you'll highlight in green and we could just click it once. [0:09:39]
 I don't know, answer that. Now we've got the more selected. Let's add a diameter this. Let's come up [0:09:47]
 and we're looking for this diameter here. This may be in a different place from your toolbar. [0:09:53]
 We're looking for the constrained diameter. This will add a constraint across the wall. [0:09:58]
 So that's hand 10mm and here okay. We get the constraint here and we get a quality constraint [0:10:07]
 going across all the holes. This means if we do change this, say 15mm, all the others will change. [0:10:14]
 Now if we look for the way this is built, this is built over these two lines. [0:10:22]
 The vertical and horizontal, which allows for symmetry across this. [0:10:28]
 So before we get these two in line, we can add a symmetry constraint in here. [0:10:35]
 So taking this point and this point then we have to select where we want this symmetrical over. [0:10:43]
 I'll start from the top here so we're going to take this center point. [0:10:48]
 And this center point and the last item is the one we want symmetry across. [0:10:54]
 So for instance we want it across this vertical axis. So we just click it and add the symmetry constraint. [0:11:02]
 These are now symmetrical across that line and we can move those in and out, [0:11:10]
 move them up and down and they will stay on that line that in symmetry to each other. [0:11:16]
 We can do the same with this one and this one and use the horizontal line and use the [0:11:25]
 symmetry constraint across those two. These are now symmetrical. We can move this up and down, [0:11:32]
 left and right and we got symmetry across those. But we've got one that's left over. [0:11:38]
 Now the previous video we used horizontal and vertical constraints and we can do the same with this one. [0:11:42]
 So we click this point and this point and use the vertical constraint. [0:11:49]
 That pulls that in line and we just did the same with this point and this point and use the horizontal [0:12:02]
 constraint. We have now places with symmetry across this line. What's good about this is that we [0:12:09]
 can reduce the amount of constraints that we did in our last video. For instance we can take [0:12:15]
 this point now and set this a distance away from here and this will be all fully constrained. [0:12:22]
 Before we used horizontal vertical constraints to place these in constraint with each other [0:12:27]
 and then use this point and this one created length constraints again so and did the same down here. [0:12:34]
 This time we just need to create constraint between this point and this point [0:12:40]
 placing a height of 10mm and then do the same this point and this point by creating a length. [0:12:53]
 You can see everything has become fully constrained underneath and has placed 10mm in there. [0:13:00]
 Let's have a look at what we got. We've got less tattin constraints to deal with [0:13:10]
 which makes a much need to sketch and we can just take these and pull them across over the left [0:13:19]
 hand side and we can see how that's been made up. As it closed and now we have our pat with the holes [0:13:30]
 with it. We can take this further by double click on the sketch and create in arcs for our [0:13:37]
 fillets rather than using the fillet tool. But how do we create an arc in this when we connect it up [0:13:43]
 all this geometry? Well there is a fillet tool within the sketch and it can be accessed up here [0:13:50]
 fillets. There are two tools here we've got a sketch fillet and a constraint preserving sketch fillet. [0:13:57]
 If we look at the fillet by just creating a simple rectangle over here we can understand how it works. [0:14:06]
 So I've created a simple rectangle and I'm going to use a fillet tool to base it for the [0:14:14]
 tool not the constraint preserving sketch fillet so I've selected and then you can see our mouse [0:14:20]
 pointer has changed to across hairs with the fillet tool there and we select one side [0:14:26]
 look what we've selected so you can see I've selected here and if I select here it creates an arc [0:14:35]
 between those. Let's come out to edit and I'm doing and try that game but this time I'm going to [0:14:43]
 select over here and then select just here. You can see what's happened and arc has been placed [0:14:54]
 on the first point that we selected and it's created an arc through there. You may be wondering [0:15:02]
 why it didn't create an arc here and that's because it would require a bee spine to go that so this [0:15:07]
 is a standard arc that's been created. Control Z to undo and we'll just place a small arc [0:15:16]
 between these two. This is exactly the same if I hit the right mouse button to get the mouse [0:15:23]
 point back it's exactly the same as taking these two points and creating this arc between them. [0:15:29]
 So if I hit delete on the keyboard I'll select in that I can come up to my arc and I'm going to drop [0:15:36]
 this one down to end point and room point and I'm going to hover over that point to question [0:15:42]
 come across quidson and we can create an arc there like so. Get a last point about we're [0:15:50]
 hitting the right mouse button and box let click and drag and we're going to delete that selection. [0:15:59]
 Let's come back to our sketch and zoom in. Let's add a fillet between these two points and see what [0:16:08]
 happens click on the fillet tool and select where we want the fillet to be. You notice something that [0:16:18]
 this is no longer constrained it's in white all the rest is in green as it added and undo [0:16:28]
 and have a look at the constraint preserving sketch for that. [0:16:33]
 Try again so you process. What's happened is that we now got this point here and we've got this arc [0:16:45]
 so we've got this extra point. Let's try it up here so we're going to click this line and this line [0:16:56]
 and now we get that for the look at this point. You notice that all the constraints have [0:17:08]
 been preserved around that point so we've got the length going across here and it's connected [0:17:15]
 out there and we have the 10mm preserved here. It's a 10mm of this circle away from here [0:17:24]
 for hit controls that I used a different fillet tool so the first one, the sketch for that and try that. [0:17:33]
 The constraints get removed so the constraint preserving fillet will be the best one to use [0:17:42]
 if we do these fillets and add in them to our sketch but we still have to add additional constraints [0:17:50]
 so let's go ahead and add constraint preserving sketch for that to these sides. Remember all it is [0:18:00]
 is an arc and we'll come over and add it to this side as well so we'll start with one side at the top [0:18:08]
 and we'll work away along. So we added these arcs just going to hit the right mass button to get [0:18:17]
 the mouse button back and we're just going to move these out the way so we can see this arc in here. [0:18:24]
 Let's add some diameter to this arc and come up and use constraint diameter and we're set [0:18:37]
 that one to 10mm. We can see we're starting to get some constraint back in to our sketch. [0:18:45]
 Let's do the same over this side. Now remember before that if we add a constraint to here [0:18:52]
 we can copy the constraint over. One way of doing that is clicking on here on this arc [0:19:01]
 come over to the other side and clicking on this one so we've got both selected and using the [0:19:09]
 quality constraint equals. We're now back in constraint. If you didn't know about this you'll [0:19:16]
 probably go through and start adding constraints to these lines but it's simple as using the constraint [0:19:23]
 preserving for that and adding those in. Let's add them to the other side as well again using this [0:19:31]
 fillet and add in the fillet in. Get the mouse put it back with a right mouse button click [0:19:50]
 and come in and select both of these and this one and use inequality. We're now for the [0:20:02]
 constraint again and if close we can see we have a fitted base and one single pad. [0:20:13]
 We're going to do the same with the other sketch that sits upon here but we're going to hit a [0:20:21]
 slight problem because if you remember before what we did will slip this face, create a sketch upon [0:20:28]
 that face. Pull in geometry using this dumb geometry tool and then add it a rectangle of sketch across here [0:20:40]
 to the left to pad this up. This is just what demonstration purpose is I'm fully constrained here [0:20:47]
 and if we pad this up that's just here okay for the time being. Then in our previous video we actually [0:20:57]
 fitted off these edges here. This is out of bandwidth restricted ourselves and we're saying we're not [0:21:02]
 going to be using this. We're going to try to do this all with sketches. So what do we do? Well let's [0:21:08]
 come over to that last action that pad and hit the lead on the keyboard. We've got this sketch [0:21:15]
 and I'm going to click on it and hit the lead again. So go back to our original pad. [0:21:21]
 I'm going to attack this from a different plane so I'm going to go from this plane. Therefore [0:21:28]
 I can create a sketch in the middle and pad out this way. So we're looking to create a sketch [0:21:36]
 upon the front plane or the accept plane and then move the sketch into the middle and [0:21:44]
 pad out from there. To do that we've got a number of options. We can either click this face [0:21:50]
 and a sketch. So we're sketching upon this plane and then what we'll do is coming to the model [0:22:02]
 come down to the sketch and we can see we've got an attachment and we can move that [0:22:09]
 in the position or we can come out of here and just delete that sketch. Make sure nothing is [0:22:20]
 selected so I'm going to select space and I'm just going to hit and create a sketch. You'll [0:22:28]
 ask us what plane we want so we want the zx plane to come down look at the zx plane and hit okay. [0:22:37]
 We can see from the crosshairs that's quoted a sketch in the middle of this plane with no [0:22:44]
 attachment to the model we've just attached it to the base plane. Now there is an advantage [0:22:49]
 about this because if we attach the sketch to here something changed it may cause an error we would [0:22:56]
 have to go back and reattaps that sketch again because we have symmetry in this model we can [0:23:01]
 create a sketch along this plane and have it centered straight away in the center so now we're [0:23:09]
 going to create a sketch upon this plane. Now remember in back to what we did before when we added a [0:23:17]
 whole we must be careful of creating a multiple object for instance if I created my rectangle here [0:23:26]
 and it's floating above then we're going to close and try to plant this sketch using the pad [0:23:35]
 everything disappears so I hit okay we can see the pad results in multiple solids [0:23:43]
 to how do we resolve that? The secancel and come back into our sketch we've got the rectangle in here [0:23:52]
 we need to attach it to this object again we're going to pull in some geometry as we did in the last [0:23:59]
 video so we'll be sketching upon this plane the top which is the xy plane we can still pull in [0:24:12]
 geometry from anywhere on this object for instance let's take the external geometry tool click it [0:24:19]
 zoom in and pull in this side here so I've pulled in that side if we look we can see there's a dot [0:24:28]
 right in the middle let's do the same on the long this side as well so click on that side [0:24:35]
 that edge there and we get that dot now I've hit the right mouse button and bring us around to [0:24:46]
 the front again we can click on this point and the point that we've imported from this stone [0:24:53]
 geometry she connects this edge and use a quince and constraint and we still have a [0:25:02]
 degree of freedom here so we need to let this point and this point and create that quince and [0:25:09]
 constraint again so you can see we've got over constraint so we've got constraint of six [0:25:16]
 that's over constraint that's click that and what you'll notice is that the constraint is actually [0:25:23]
 hidden down here so this will be a horizontal constraint because we don't need that to see through [0:25:28]
 this model we can use the section view this icon here for you section and that cuts that model [0:25:37]
 in half from our viewpoint so we can see inside that and we can see that constraint is sitting there [0:25:43]
 this one here just hit delete and now this length here is for the constraint let's play it's a height [0:25:51]
 click on this end or this end and use constraint of vertical distance now set this one to 25 millimeters [0:26:01]
 and here enter now we've got this in here fully constrained and we can use this for padding [0:26:12]
 because it's connected to our model as it closed let's see what happens when we pad this [0:26:20]
 so click on the sketch we'll hit the pad and you can see we've successfully padded this it's [0:26:31]
 padded this forward from our center point but we need it centered along that sketch so our [0:26:40]
 sketch was here going right through the center so if we come down and look at the options what we [0:26:49]
 have here we've got reverse that's ended backward and we got symmetrical to play which places it in the [0:26:56]
 middle that's add a 5 millimeter pad to that and click off and now we've got our pad going up [0:27:05]
 and we model in from two different planes the x-set plane and the x-wiping [0:27:15]
 let's hit okay and now we have two pads and we haven't added a pocket or a fillet yet [0:27:23]
 well we need to fill it these sides and that's the same as what we did before [0:27:30]
 open up this pad spanned out the item in the tree view and double click the sketch with it [0:27:38]
 let's zoom in and we're going to use the fillet but again we're going to use the constraint [0:27:46]
 preserving sketch for that and we're just going to add a fillet to this side we're going to move [0:27:54]
 over to the right side and do the same the worried about the position of the fillet we're going to [0:27:59]
 control that fire radius or a diameter now click the right mass button to get the mass point [0:28:08]
 back and select both the fillets fund diameter and set the diameter say to 20 millimeters [0:28:22]
 you can see it's gone fully constrained and we may need to change the diameter [0:28:28]
 to what we feel appropriate [0:28:31]
 once we're happy with diameter then we can hit close and we've replaced the model [0:28:46]
 this time for much more compact workflow now one thing to remember is that we haven't [0:28:54]
 quite finished we need to create the fillet in between these lines unfortunately we can't do that [0:29:01]
 we're sketching we could take a different route with something such as a loft but that's a bit [0:29:06]
 advanced for this type of object so what we're going to do is just add the fillet in here [0:29:14]
 so this line here we can click come around to the other side and control click [0:29:21]
 the other line our fillet is now on limits and we can add it again you can see i'm adding this as a [0:29:31]
 last action so this is the last action that we're doing i know that i don't want to model this [0:29:38]
 any further so we just finish it off and we'll change the fillet [0:29:44]
 something like five millimeters six millimeters it comes back is in error [0:29:51]
 let's drop that down to five millimeters and here okay [0:29:56]
 now the other thing is is that we may want to fillets these holes or chamfer them [0:30:04]
 so we set these holes in to allow the screw to sit deeper in this hole [0:30:09]
 if we come up to the top we can see we've got a chamfer tool as well so we can click on that [0:30:16]
 and we get a chamfered hole within that's add the other edges [0:30:22]
 and select two millimeters that's a bit too much so we can go for one millimeter [0:30:42]
 and i think i'm going between so 1.5 click off we can see that's taken effect and here okay [0:30:55]
 the chamfer is a dress up so we'll look up the part design [0:31:03]
 apply a dress up feature and we can see the fillet and chamfer is in there again that's [0:31:10]
 something to use last of all just to finish off our model so what we're going to do now is [0:31:17]
 document what we've done by creating a technical drawing this allows us to create a number of [0:31:22]
 drawings from different views of this object and add dimensions to that drawing to do that we're [0:31:27]
 going to come over to the tech drawer workbench just going to go for the basis and the minimum [0:31:33]
 steps to get a very simple technical drawing we first need a page so come out to the tech drawer [0:31:40]
 and i'm going to insert the page using the template we've got a number of SVG templates and you can [0:31:46]
 make your own i'm just going to go for a blank page so i'm going to scroll down and use the [0:31:53]
 A4PoolTree blank and open that up we've got our page and we can see the page has opened along the [0:32:01]
 left hand side now to add a few in here from the model we first need to click on the body [0:32:09]
 make sure we have it in the right few points see something like this and then come out to [0:32:19]
 tech drawer insert view or use this icon all left hand side here come back to the page you will notice [0:32:27]
 that a few has been inserted don't worry about the black dots around here we'll remove those in a minute [0:32:33]
 the quickest way to get a number of views in here because we can come back and bring this [0:32:39]
 around into another projection and do the same make sure the body is selected and insert a view [0:32:47]
 so we get another one the quickest way of doing this is add a projection group [0:32:53]
 so let's remove these two views by shift clicking those to step more control clicking and hit the [0:33:00]
 link so i'm going to first add a free d view so i'm going to go for something like this [0:33:11]
 I'm going to use the corner of this cube just to position myself so that that body [0:33:19]
 and go up to tech drawer insert view so we have our first view in the page [0:33:26]
 I'm now going to do the same but i'm going to swap this view to the top [0:33:33]
 this time i'm going to click the body count to tech drawer and we're going to insert a projection group [0:33:42]
 on the left hand side you can see that our window has changed and we've got a number of options [0:33:48]
 in here go back to the page we can see we've got this view here which i'm going to push up to the top [0:33:55]
 and we've got a projection view i'm just going to scroll or zoom out to scroll down [0:34:02]
 and just move this down out of the way and this is from the top and though it says from the front [0:34:08]
 we can now take the secondary projections and click to decide which views we want so i'm going to use [0:34:18]
 this one and the top one showed the bottom we've got a just primary direction here so we can swap [0:34:26]
 this one around and project different views in different ways [0:34:32]
 i'm going to go for this one but we need to make some adjustments to this side here and [0:34:41]
 though this is front we can adjust the labels of these as well [0:34:45]
 this is going to the top and hit OK now if we look at the projection group we have the front [0:34:54]
 the right and the bottom that's click on the front click on the label and rename this one to top [0:35:06]
 and hit enter and come down to the label so we can adjust the name in of these to what we see [0:35:12]
 it that's rotate this one around such around the right way click on it come down to the data tab [0:35:24]
 and look for rotation and we'll set this one to 90 degrees you can see we've got blue tick [0:35:30]
 that means it needs refreshing to get come up to edit refresh or hit control or we can see this [0:35:37]
 is rotated around but it's round the wrong way so i'm going to go minus 90 [0:35:42]
 and hit control on the keyboard that's now round the right way these move as one so we can move this [0:35:52]
 down because right hand side here now we've got our basic projections of our model on screen [0:35:59]
 now one thing you might be thinking about is the size of the points on here so i'm just going to [0:36:06]
 zoom in and we see that we have a number of points that are the vertexes of your model these may [0:36:15]
 look a bit big but if we went to file print preview what we've seen is that the print preview [0:36:22]
 doesn't actually show those they just show an all diagram we can actually hide these points [0:36:32]
 from our view if we so desired by coming over to the right hand side here and looking for [0:36:40]
 this icon here turn view frames on or off also available from tetra all [0:36:44]
 to view frames on or off and you can see those points have disappeared there's also [0:36:52]
 certain so if we go up to edit preferences what you'll see now is that we've have an icon on the left [0:37:00]
 hand side because we started to use the tech draw we click on that icon we got a number of options [0:37:07]
 in here font label size and then we have this vertex go here so we can reduce this down to say [0:37:17]
 one here apply and okay we'll just come out of the show frame mode and you can see that [0:37:28]
 vertex has been reduced down now now the good thing about leaving the vertex as it is is that [0:37:34]
 they're easily selectable when you actually click the dimensions in so using these dimensions [0:37:39]
 tools here so i'm going to go back into the preferences and set that back to five in the scale [0:37:48]
 and that down to the vertex go and increases up to five and here apply [0:37:56]
 then you may not see this take a fixed straight away we can come up to the tetra and redraw page [0:38:03]
 and then these come back the icon is also available on the toolbar redraw page here so if [0:38:13]
 none of those settings do take a fit we can just press that button to allow us to refresh that page [0:38:18]
 that's add some dimensions to these items on screen so scroll down and take a look [0:38:29]
 at the top view we can decide where we want to place the lengths taken account we have this [0:38:37]
 fill it here if we want to take a length then we're going to have to use this point [0:38:42]
 and this point and you can see how easy those are to select now this is different to the [0:38:51]
 sketcher we would have to use the control key so i'm holding down the control selected one [0:38:56]
 hold down the control and select the other those two have been highlighted in green and they're [0:39:03]
 selected so if i zoom in a bit more we can see those are highlighted in green [0:39:07]
 and we just use this position ourselves now I can place an insert for a call dimension [0:39:16]
 that place is the dimension across these and I can click on where it has the dimension [0:39:25]
 hold down the mouse button and drag this out into position also can drag upwards if i want [0:39:31]
 to dimension to be above which is going to place this one here that's do the same for some [0:39:36]
 width so i'm going to take this one click once hold down the control and click again [0:39:42]
 this time i'm going to use horizontal dimension [0:39:47]
 and we can place this where we want so i'm just going to place it here for the fillets [0:39:57]
 we can click on the fillet and come up and use the radius dimension [0:40:06]
 and i place this is the radius in there and we're just drag this into position [0:40:12]
 we can do the same for this inner radius this circle going to never lock [0:40:20]
 and we can see that's going in there we can if i delete that just by clicking on it and [0:40:28]
 hitting delete click on the inner circle come up and place the dimension across the [0:40:36]
 riven then use the radius and we can move that off again to the side [0:40:42]
 now we've got these dimensions in here that's work on a different view so i'm going to [0:40:51]
 scroll us the top and work on this view here now i'm looking for dimensions that i haven't already [0:40:58]
 specified in there so one of them is this radius here for this arc [0:41:03]
 and we can go for height in here if we've got a single line like this that we don't need to [0:41:18]
 slap the vertex as we would do we say the length here because we haven't got a line between these [0:41:24]
 because they're separated with this arc here we can just select the line and use the vertical [0:41:35]
 dimension in there we have this dimension here now and we can add dimensions to any of our [0:41:44]
 views as we see fit and this point and this point using the ctrl key [0:41:59]
 in my place a height and it's the simple stuff now let's come up to file [0:42:10]
 print preview and see what this is going to look like and we're zoom in and just scroll down to [0:42:18]
 have a look this is good but we haven't got any of the labels coming through and we can solve that [0:42:24]
 by coming over to one of these views and click on them let's click this view here and i'm just [0:42:32]
 going to go back to the example and have a look to see where that is so that's from the left side [0:42:38]
 so it can come back as the page click on this view here and come over to the data [0:42:47]
 you can see that's our view has been selected come down to the caption i'm just going to add in [0:42:59]
 left few now when i go to file print preview we can see our caption has been added [0:43:13]
 i still the same for the others so i front view and this one is our top view [0:43:32]
 vetted old captions and this one we just add 3d view now i want to add a title [0:43:50]
 got a 10th draw come down to annotations [0:43:58]
 and we've got a number of different annotations here i'm just going to insert an annotation [0:44:06]
 we get this view box here that we can move into position and i'm just going to double click [0:44:15]
 that to get the text up and give it a title and finally here okay we can change the properties [0:44:30]
 of this title i click on the annotation coming down and we've got a number of different styles [0:44:39]
 fonts etc here so i can increase the text size now pressing the up key to increase that [0:44:46]
 text size or can use the up key or type in or want here remember to save as you go along [0:44:56]
 and let's have a quick preview of what the screen looks like file print preview [0:45:03]
 and we can see from the print preview that we need to form that in we can see how to put [0:45:10]
 a technical drawing together quite easily anytime we can come up to file export PDF [0:45:17]
 or come into the text draw and export page as sfg or export page as dxf [0:45:25]
 there are a number of other options in here such as insert bitmap add lines [0:45:30]
 add vertices etc we can experiment with those as you feel the need [0:45:37]
 so now we finish with the part and produce a technical drawing and we've got more knowledge [0:45:43]
 of free CAD through using the sketch as well as introducing another workbench [0:45:48]
 by now you've realized that sketching is a fundamental part of free CAD we're going to be [0:45:54]
 exploring that further in the next video by using the image workbench and the sketcher together [0:46:01]
 that'll last take a photograph of say an object that we have and trace that in the [0:46:05]
 sketcher to last to recreate it in free CAD through that we're going to be learning much more [0:46:11]
 about the sketcher a fundamental part of free CAD so look forward to seeing you in the next video [0:46:17]
