===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD for Beginners 29 - Surfacing Workflows - Split and Join - Spherical window in a curved panel =====
 Hi everyone, welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of the Learning [0:00:04]
 Freak Have for Beginners. [0:00:05]
 We will teach the fundamentals of the Freak Had from a beginning perspective whilst we learn [0:00:08]
 workflows. [0:00:09]
 We are moving on to surfacing workflows. [0:00:12]
 And today we are going to be looking at creating this object using a split surface. [0:00:17]
 We are going to be following both a part workflow for a surface and a part workflow for [0:00:24]
 a solid. [0:00:25]
 So this one is done with just open geometry and do in surfaces and shelves and this one [0:00:32]
 is done with a solid. [0:00:36]
 So there are differences in here. [0:00:37]
 I am going to be showing both workflows. [0:00:40]
 Giving you both the workflows so you can choose between them as you may want to use one [0:00:45]
 over the other for certain applications. [0:00:47]
 And you will get an understanding of where you use those in the future. [0:00:50]
 The more practice and the more knowledge you gain. [0:00:53]
 So I hope you join these videos and that is how to look at this workflow. [0:00:57]
 If you like we have seen please subscribe to the site. [0:00:59]
 I also have a co-fire or a coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that [0:01:04]

 Also run a patreon where you can subscribe and get extra content. [0:01:14]
 And that is at www.putrium.com, 4-mango jelly solutions. [0:01:18]
 Any money that is currently donated will be used to span the channel. [0:01:22]
 So we will just establish that we are using a part workflow. [0:01:24]
 So we are going to create a new document and first thing I am going to do is do the revolve. [0:01:29]
 And so we are going to need a profile. [0:01:31]
 So I am going to come into the sketcher. [0:01:32]
 I am going to create a new sketch along the x-eplane. [0:01:38]
 So new sketch, x-eplane and ok. [0:01:42]
 I am going to create an arc using an m.rm.org. [0:01:46]
 I am going to span the center and this y-axis. [0:01:53]
 Place an arc in there and we are just going to take the middle of the arc and place it [0:01:58]
 along that y-axis with point-on-line constraint. [0:02:01]
 So we have our arc, make sure it is connected along the x-axis. [0:02:07]
 Again with a point-on-line constraint. [0:02:09]
 Let us close the sketch and come back over to the part we are at the edge and create [0:02:14]
 a rotate. [0:02:15]
 So we make sure the sketch is selected. [0:02:17]
 Use a revolve button, we will come up to part and revolve. [0:02:22]
 Next we need to choose the global axis to rotate this on. [0:02:26]
 We look down to the right, we can see an navigation handler and I am going to go along the x-axis. [0:02:31]
 So x is running this way. [0:02:34]
 The action x and we need to be 180 degrees. [0:02:40]
 It is half a sphere and it goes symmetrical angles. [0:02:44]
 If I hit ok, we get our sphere rotated. [0:02:49]
 Now this point is up to you how you want this. [0:02:53]
 At the moment I have got basically almost up on the lips. [0:02:57]
 I can come back into the revolve and come into the sketch and decide that I actually want [0:03:02]
 the sphere but bring this up. [0:03:06]
 Connect it to the center, if I want to do. [0:03:11]
 I have got the order to remove redundant constraints so that is to remove that constraint. [0:03:18]
 You can see that we have the sphere. [0:03:23]
 Now I have got the sphere that has a look at the surface I want to create. [0:03:27]
 For that I am going to be using the x-z plane. [0:03:30]
 I am going to be sketching a single line. [0:03:32]
 At the moment we are working in surfaces. [0:03:34]
 So come into the x-z plane. [0:03:36]
 Looking at that position. [0:03:38]
 Come over to the sketcher. [0:03:40]
 Create a sketch, make sure nothing is selected. [0:03:43]
 That means when I create a sketch we get the planes come up. [0:03:46]
 I want to attach into. [0:03:48]
 I want it along the x-z plane. [0:03:51]
 Now if you are in this from the x-z plane, we are going to mention that this will [0:03:56]
 section through the center because we have placed this symmetrical to the center. [0:03:59]
 We need to come out to sketch. [0:04:01]
 And a few sections to section view. [0:04:03]
 So we can see through that. [0:04:05]
 Now my surface, I can sketch in with a single piece of geometry. [0:04:09]
 I am going to use the endpoint and RunePoint arc. [0:04:13]
 That is a U which one you want to use. [0:04:15]
 You can use a B-spline if you want. [0:04:17]
 So I am going to click on that. [0:04:19]
 And I am going to place my surface in. [0:04:23]
 So my surface is in long here. [0:04:27]
 And we are going to take these two points. [0:04:31]
 I have got the Ultra Remove Redunited Constraints on. [0:04:33]
 And the center point. [0:04:35]
 I make this symmetrical. [0:04:37]
 Using the symmetry constraint. [0:04:41]
 So my surface, sketching in, is going to be something like this. [0:04:47]
 If I hit close, we can see that sketch runs through the center of this object. [0:04:53]
 Now I am going to move to the part. [0:04:55]
 And click on that sketch. [0:04:57]
 And it is through it. [0:04:59]
 I am going to extrude this. [0:05:01]
 By some length, go 50mm. [0:05:03]
 But I am going to make sure it is symmetrical. [0:05:05]
 So it comes out from the end and the front. [0:05:09]
 I hit OK. [0:05:11]
 See how that is extruded. [0:05:13]
 So extrusion is not enough. [0:05:15]
 Come back in. [0:05:17]
 And we are going to set it to. [0:05:19]
 Something like 100mm. [0:05:21]
 And the length. [0:05:22]
 Just get through this and show you the technique. [0:05:25]
 So what we got is the sphere and the surface that I want to place. [0:05:29]
 This dome across. [0:05:31]
 We will remove this section in a moment. [0:05:35]
 Next thing I want to do is look at the profile of what I want to create from the top. [0:05:41]
 So we got this here. [0:05:43]
 I will create a profile in the sketch. [0:05:47]
 This is going to be close sketch. [0:05:49]
 So I am going to make sure nothing is selected. [0:05:51]
 And create a sketch. [0:05:53]
 Again, it is going to place me upon one of the base planes. [0:05:57]
 So I am going to go for the x y plane. [0:05:59]
 I am going to have it in a panel. [0:06:05]
 So this is where we have the sketch in the actual panel. [0:06:09]
 I am going to come into the rectangle. [0:06:13]
 I am going to use a round of rectangle. [0:06:15]
 And sketch a rectangle in here. [0:06:17]
 It is actually behind. [0:06:19]
 So that is used as sketch. [0:06:21]
 View section. [0:06:22]
 So I can see through there. [0:06:24]
 So I can see the circle. [0:06:25]
 And I can see the sides of the surface. [0:06:28]
 And I have placed my rounded rectangle in there. [0:06:33]
 And we can make some constraints. [0:06:35]
 So I am taking these two and making this symmetrical to the centre. [0:06:38]
 Using. [0:06:40]
 The symmetry constraint. [0:06:41]
 I am not going to just constrain this right down again because we are working at speed. [0:06:46]
 But I am just going to place constraints in here. [0:06:49]
 Just to get them centered. [0:06:51]
 And I am just going to pull these in. [0:06:53]
 Like so. [0:06:54]
 So that is now. [0:06:57]
 My view. [0:06:59]
 So if I come back to the sketch. [0:07:02]
 View section. [0:07:03]
 We can see how that sits there. [0:07:06]
 That is in close. [0:07:08]
 The sketch sits under the surface. [0:07:12]
 And what I am going to do is click on the sketch. [0:07:15]
 Come over to the part. [0:07:17]
 Make sure it is sketchy selected. [0:07:19]
 And I am going to screw this. [0:07:21]
 Let's do this up. [0:07:23]
 Round about 15mm. [0:07:25]
 But. [0:07:27]
 This screw is created as a solid which I don't want. [0:07:30]
 I am working with surfaces. [0:07:33]
 So I want to change this to a surface. [0:07:37]
 Or what would be your shell. [0:07:39]
 So I click on that. [0:07:40]
 Come into the screw to come down to the solid. [0:07:42]
 And that this. [0:07:43]
 To force. [0:07:45]
 Therefore I have a shell in there. [0:07:48]
 I can use to split this surface here. [0:07:53]
 If I try to split this with a solid. [0:07:56]
 It might not produce the effect that I want. [0:08:01]
 So let's move on to split in these now. [0:08:04]
 I want to click the surface style. [0:08:07]
 I want to keep this one here. [0:08:09]
 And I want to strap out this shape from this surface. [0:08:15]
 Like so. [0:08:19]
 Now come up to part. [0:08:21]
 After control selecting both of those. [0:08:23]
 So I selected the surface. [0:08:24]
 This one here. [0:08:25]
 And then control clicked. [0:08:26]
 This. [0:08:27]
 This. [0:08:28]
 This rectangle. [0:08:30]
 Can't. [0:08:31]
 Part. [0:08:32]
 Split. [0:08:33]
 Slice a part. [0:08:35]
 And it looks like a face that's being imprinted on this surface. [0:08:38]
 Here. [0:08:39]
 If I click on the inside face, which is the right shape, you'll see that we get some slices on the left hand side inside of older. [0:08:48]
 Now I want to keep this slice. [0:08:52]
 So I'm going to rename that as panel size. [0:08:57]
 And I'm going to click on the other one, which is this outside part. [0:09:01]
 And press the space part. [0:09:02]
 This will hide it from view. [0:09:05]
 I now got to do the same with the sphere. [0:09:13]
 Which is the revolve. [0:09:15]
 So click on the one I want to keep the panel. [0:09:19]
 Control click the sphere. [0:09:21]
 Go to part. [0:09:23]
 Split. [0:09:25]
 Slice a part. [0:09:27]
 We now have the circle inside. [0:09:30]
 But the revolve has disappeared. [0:09:32]
 This is what we want because we want to actually remove this circle as well. [0:09:36]
 So click on that circle. [0:09:38]
 We can see inside that we got a slice. [0:09:41]
 Dojo1.1. [0:09:43]
 Press the space bar. [0:09:44]
 That gets rid of that. [0:09:46]
 The panel slice. [0:09:49]
 What we want to keep now is this one. [0:09:53]
 So we're going to rename that one. [0:09:56]
 Right click. [0:09:57]
 Rename. [0:09:58]
 And call this one. [0:10:01]
 Channel slice. [0:10:03]
 We've hold. [0:10:05]
 So what's happened to our revolve? [0:10:10]
 Well, this is embedded in this pound slice here. [0:10:13]
 So if I open this up and open up the slice zero one, we can see the revolve is sitting in here. [0:10:19]
 So these are the objects that create this operation. [0:10:22]
 I'm going to press the space bar on that revolve. [0:10:25]
 To get it back. [0:10:27]
 This time I'm going to do the reverse. [0:10:30]
 So I'm going to click on the revolve. [0:10:32]
 Or when I want to keep. [0:10:33]
 And control click. [0:10:34]
 The panel slice with hold. [0:10:37]
 And again, I'm going to cut the part. [0:10:39]
 Split. [0:10:41]
 And slice apart. [0:10:43]
 We've now got this slice running around here. [0:10:48]
 Which I don't want. [0:10:49]
 So I'm going to click on that and press the space bar. [0:10:52]
 So we've got our new revolve slice. [0:10:55]
 We're going to rename. [0:10:59]
 To revolve slice. [0:11:04]
 Inside that revolve slice, that's just shrink these two up. [0:11:09]
 So we've got the revolve slice inside that. [0:11:12]
 We have a slice zero two. [0:11:14]
 And inside that, we have the original revolve. [0:11:16]
 And the panel slice with hold. [0:11:19]
 Press the space bar. [0:11:20]
 That brings back this slice here. [0:11:24]
 And you can see those are sliced apart in a way that we can join these two together [0:11:30]
 and produce one surface. [0:11:32]
 So to do that, we can use a fuse. [0:11:34]
 So that's a union. [0:11:36]
 So the boonine operations work on surfaces as well as solids. [0:11:41]
 So we just let both those. [0:11:42]
 Control, select both of those. [0:11:44]
 Selecting in here. [0:11:45]
 And come up to part. [0:11:48]
 Boonine. [0:11:50]
 And union. [0:11:51]
 We can select it from the toolbar if you want. [0:11:53]
 Just up here on the toolbar. [0:11:55]
 Once those are union, what happened is the fusion. [0:11:59]
 Resolve the union will be placed inside this folder. [0:12:03]
 We can take that and drag it up onto the top project. [0:12:07]
 The unnamed project that I've got at the moment because I haven't saved it. [0:12:10]
 And drop it in there. [0:12:12]
 So just drop it in there. [0:12:14]
 And you can see the fusion is sitting there now. [0:12:17]
 And that's the fusion that's been created. [0:12:21]
 So we're starting to get some shape to our fusion. [0:12:25]
 Now we want to add some thickness to this. [0:12:29]
 There's a couple ways we can do it, but I'm going to be using a 3D offset. [0:12:33]
 So click on the fusion. [0:12:35]
 We got this icon on toolbar which is the 3D offset. [0:12:38]
 We don't see it. [0:12:39]
 We can drop this down and you can see 2D 3D offset there. [0:12:42]
 But I'm going to use the part and come down to the 3D offset because these menus don't really change. [0:12:49]
 So they will be there all the time. [0:12:51]
 When we hit that, why actually happens if we create a 3D offset. [0:12:54]
 So we create enough thickness to this. [0:12:57]
 And we're offset setting that in 3D space. [0:13:01]
 So we can fill that thickness if we want. [0:13:04]
 Quick fill. [0:13:05]
 And we can add some offset to this. [0:13:07]
 So that's add a 2mm offset. [0:13:10]
 Like so. [0:13:12]
 And we're created that there. [0:13:15]
 That's okay. [0:13:16]
 Last thing I'm going to do now is add some blending between these with a fillet. [0:13:22]
 Must be stressed that if we look at the offset, we're coming to here. [0:13:26]
 The fusion is still available. [0:13:28]
 So it's still visible. [0:13:30]
 We need to click on that and press the space bar. [0:13:33]
 The reason why that's visible is because the offset has two options. [0:13:36]
 Once the field option and once just an offset option. [0:13:40]
 So in both cases we've got two outputs. [0:13:43]
 We could say that the offset that is filled should be hidden. [0:13:47]
 But by default they're both kept visible. [0:13:50]
 So we've got to come in here to make that invisible. [0:13:53]
 If we don't, we have the chance to let an fusion and add in a fillet. [0:13:58]
 We're supposed to add in the fillet to the offset. [0:14:01]
 So now when I select the edge of that runs around this here. [0:14:06]
 And come up and apply the fillet. [0:14:12]
 And set this to say, free millimeter and hit enter. [0:14:17]
 We get this fillet that runs around here. [0:14:21]
 And we can just let fillet. [0:14:24]
 We'll double-click on that and send it to whatever we want. [0:14:31]
 You can still see the sketch that runs along here. [0:14:35]
 So I click on that. You can see the sketch is there. [0:14:37]
 Just press the space bar that hides the sketch. [0:14:40]
 So now what we've done is attached two surfaces together. [0:14:45]
 One a curved surface. This could be planar for wanted it. [0:14:49]
 And a dome. A spherical dome there. [0:14:54]
 And we've done some slicing kinds of surfaces to allow them to be attached together. [0:14:59]
 Take a look at the same workflow but this time we'll solid. [0:15:03]
 So for this one we have the same objects. [0:15:07]
 Set for this a strewt. We've changed the solid to true. [0:15:12]
 This one we've a strewted upwards as well as sideways. [0:15:17]
 So we have sideways first and then we'll open up. [0:15:20]
 We just create the thickness. [0:15:22]
 And this revolve. If we look in here and look at the sketch. [0:15:26]
 You can see I've got closed geometry for the sketch. [0:15:32]
 So we have free solid objects. [0:15:35]
 I'm going to first hide this is strewt. [0:15:38]
 And we're going to be dealing with these two first. [0:15:42]
 So first of all I'm going to take this revolve and control quick surface. [0:15:49]
 And cut to part split and slice apart. [0:15:54]
 What we now have is free slices inside. [0:15:58]
 So if I open this up we can see we've got free. [0:16:01]
 So we've got this one. [0:16:02]
 This middle section. [0:16:05]
 And this slice. [0:16:06]
 And this is due because if we look at the original slice. [0:16:12]
 Which was being removed. [0:16:15]
 This strewt. [0:16:17]
 We can see that the midsection is due because of this strewt. [0:16:23]
 The thickness of that strewt. [0:16:25]
 So when we start taking these away. [0:16:28]
 Then we will left with extra faces. [0:16:32]
 That's it. At this point. [0:16:35]
 I'm going to bring back the original revolve. [0:16:39]
 I can see I've got the original revolve there. [0:16:41]
 And the original strewt. [0:16:43]
 We're going to take the one that I want to keep. [0:16:46]
 And then click the one I want to remove. [0:16:48]
 Which is the revolve. [0:16:50]
 And we're looking to create this circle in here. [0:16:53]
 This void. [0:16:56]
 Part split. [0:16:59]
 Slice apart. [0:17:02]
 I can now hide the void. [0:17:04]
 And now I've got the revolve. [0:17:07]
 And the surface. [0:17:09]
 But I do have some extra faces. [0:17:12]
 So I've got this one in here. [0:17:14]
 Which is the slice. [0:17:15]
 So we've got a slice inside here. [0:17:17]
 And you can see. [0:17:19]
 We've got. [0:17:21]
 An extra item that's been added to our chain. [0:17:25]
 We're going to do the fusion with to bring these all together. [0:17:27]
 This can just add an extra step on top. [0:17:29]
 Or can produce things that we don't want. [0:17:31]
 Or even things that we do. [0:17:33]
 For instance, we can take. [0:17:35]
 This circle. [0:17:37]
 Remove it out and add some fasteners to that. [0:17:40]
 Do some extra model on top to create a feature out of that slice. [0:17:44]
 Doing the same operations in the part design. [0:17:46]
 Trying to create this surface. [0:17:48]
 What adds extra time on top of your workflow. [0:17:51]
 We would have to create additional bodies. [0:17:53]
 It hasn't got the split operations that you've got in the part workbench. [0:17:57]
 So we're going to have to do that with booting features. [0:17:59]
 And it doesn't have the flexibility of working with solids and surfaces. [0:18:03]
 All in one workbench. [0:18:05]
 Let's complete this workflow. [0:18:07]
 And bring back the original strut. [0:18:11]
 Take the one on one to keep. [0:18:13]
 One on one to remove. [0:18:15]
 Part. [0:18:16]
 Split. [0:18:17]
 And slice apart. [0:18:19]
 Therefore. [0:18:21]
 We've got. [0:18:22]
 Our finished model. [0:18:24]
 That we're going to control sled. [0:18:26]
 Each of the parts. [0:18:27]
 And do a fusion by Boolean. [0:18:34]
 Union. [0:18:35]
 And we have finished model. [0:18:40]
 Again, we can add filetin. [0:18:42]
 Using the filet tool. [0:18:45]
 And filet badge. [0:18:47]
 And we've finished. [0:18:54]
 We've got some extra faces. [0:18:56]
 But it doesn't really matter. [0:18:59]
 We don't have to apply it a 3D offset. [0:19:03]
 Because we've got the thickness that we want for out. [0:19:06]
