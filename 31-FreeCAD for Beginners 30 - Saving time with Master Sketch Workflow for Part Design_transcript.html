===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD for Beginners 30 - Saving time with Master Sketch Workflow for Part Design =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to another episode of Learning Free Capital beginners. [0:00:03]
 We'll teach the fundamentals of free CAD whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:07]
 Today we're going to be looking at a master sketch workflow using draft clones. [0:00:11]
 What this allows us to do is create a folder that contains a number of master sketches. [0:00:17]
 In this example we're going to be using master sketches to control profile of a sweep. [0:00:22]
 We can then take one of those master sketches and use a clone inside a part design body. [0:00:31]
 This allows the main master sketch to reside in a folder that you can update without drilling into the body [0:00:37]
 and finding the profile sketch within there for the sweep. [0:00:40]
 If we had another body we can actually use the same master sketch and just clone it into there. [0:00:46]
 This means both bodies are controlled by the same sketch but sketch is easy available outside of those bodies. [0:00:52]
 We're going to be covering this technique in two videos but they both independent of each other. [0:00:59]
 The first video we're going to be looking at the master sketch workflow using those clones [0:01:03]
 to create two simple sweep in two different bodies. [0:01:06]
 We can change the profiles in total isolation to the model and show you how changing one will affect both of them. [0:01:13]
 In the second video we're going to be using a master sketch along with a parametric spreadsheet. [0:01:19]
 This will allow us to create a fully dynamic and configurable model. [0:01:24]
 Hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a look at this technique. [0:01:31]

 For this tutorial we're going to start off in the sketcher and create the profiles for the sweeps that we want. [0:02:02]
 We're going to create new document and create a new sketch. [0:02:06]
 This amount of which plane will be in a place on because we're going to use attachment to actually place the profiles in the crop position. [0:02:14]
 Let's hit OK on the x-wapling. [0:02:16]
 I'm going to create just a simple sketch now going to center it over this center point here. [0:02:22]
 For instance I'm going to use a round-of-rettangle and place it in here and center this. [0:02:31]
 Use in symmetrical constraints across the center point using the symmetrical constraint. [0:02:40]
 We have our profile. [0:02:42]
 Now you'll be wise to add some length and dimensions in here, but I'm going to leave that to later. [0:02:49]
 We're going to show you the process first and then get on to some kind of project work. [0:02:54]
 Once we get the main skills down. [0:02:57]
 This is my profile. This is my first profile. [0:02:59]
 I'm going to do is come over and close that. [0:03:02]
 I'm going to name the sketch profile one. [0:03:10]
 Come over to profile one. [0:03:12]
 Click on it and press the spacebar so it's invisible. [0:03:15]
 Let's place it out of here so we can now create a new sketch again on the same plane, the x-wapling and OK that. [0:03:23]
 This time I'm going to create a different profile. [0:03:25]
 I'm just going to go for a standard circle and place that within the center. [0:03:30]
 That's close that. [0:03:32]
 Therefore we've got another profile over here which I'm going to rename. [0:03:37]
 I'm taking my time to rename these because these are going to add as master sketches. [0:03:44]
 Now I've got these two profiles and I'm coming to the document at the top at the moment. [0:03:48]
 It's our names haven't saved it. [0:03:50]
 Right click and create group. [0:03:53]
 This creates a directory that I can place my profiles in. [0:03:56]
 Again I can rename that. [0:03:58]
 I'm going to call it profile templates. [0:04:01]
 Now I've got the two profiles. [0:04:08]
 I can control click both of these and drag them into that group. [0:04:12]
 So within the group we now have two profiles. [0:04:18]
 We just make some small amendments to this one. [0:04:25]
 Just to change the size so it's not as big. [0:04:30]
 So we've got the two profiles, two profiles. [0:04:34]
 I'm going to use these in a part design workflow. [0:04:37]
 Let's come over to the part design. [0:04:41]
 Now we must make sure that nothing is selected. [0:04:44]
 Nothing in the profiles is selected. [0:04:47]
 Nothing in the slet little screen. [0:04:48]
 That means we create a new body. [0:04:49]
 Nothing gets copied into that body. [0:04:52]
 That's important because we're going to be using these and reference them these via [0:04:55]
 some kind of link or clone. [0:04:57]
 And we'll go through that in a moment. [0:05:00]
 The next thing I'm going to do is create a simple path for that profile to follow. [0:05:05]
 Now it's going to be either or one of those profiles. [0:05:07]
 So I'm going to come into this body. [0:05:09]
 You can see it's active because it's bold. [0:05:11]
 I'll create a new sketch. [0:05:13]
 I'm going to go along the XY plane again and OK. [0:05:17]
 Now from here I'm going to sketch a simple path from this point. [0:05:21]
 So I'm going to use the polyline and come up and attach a path like so. [0:05:30]
 We're going to sweep one of these profiles along this path. [0:05:33]
 So the other thing I'm going to do is create some curvature in here as well. [0:05:38]
 To do that I'm going to use the fillet tool. [0:05:39]
 So it's up here the fillet tool or sketch. [0:05:43]
 Just draw my trees and then we can come down to the fillet tool. [0:05:47]
 Great fillet. [0:05:48]
 We've got two types of fillet here. [0:05:50]
 I'm just going to go for the law for that for the time being. [0:05:52]
 I'm just going to fill it off these edges. [0:05:57]
 So we've got curvature in there. [0:06:01]
 And we'll just make both of these equal. [0:06:08]
 So we have a path to follow. [0:06:10]
 I'm just going to place this line for a vertical constraint. [0:06:15]
 If this is highlighted in our integer tool which has come over to the solver and we will [0:06:18]
 see that we have a message here which we click on and delete the redundant constraints. [0:06:24]
 Let's close that. [0:06:26]
 Now we have our path. [0:06:28]
 We'll quickly rename that to path. [0:06:38]
 Now what I'm looking to do is take one of these profiles and sweep it along this path. [0:06:43]
 But if I wanted to do that first of all after a position of profiles correctly so they're [0:06:47]
 pointing normal to the sketch at the moment they're facing downwards and also after [0:06:54]
 bringing the profiles into the body. [0:06:56]
 But I don't want to bring these in. [0:06:59]
 Just copy them into the body because I want to keep them outside to use as a template. [0:07:04]
 The idea is if we modify any of these profiles, the changes reflect throughout. [0:07:08]
 We'll get to that in the moment. [0:07:10]
 Now I could use like a substrate binded to pull this into the body. [0:07:14]
 The trouble is with these two shape binders they don't have a property for attachment to a sketch. [0:07:20]
 And we need that with this one. [0:07:22]
 So if I took the profile this one and create a substrate binder, for click on that binder [0:07:29]
 that's inside that body now, you can see the spul. [0:07:34]
 He's actually referring to the profile and we've got no map mode so we can't use that. [0:07:41]
 The way to do this is to come over to the draft footbench. [0:07:46]
 I was just going to turn the grid in off because we don't need it with this cycle down the [0:07:50]
 bottom. [0:07:51]
 We've in the draft footbench we have clone tools. [0:07:54]
 So I'm going to click on one of the profiles and come up to the modifications and down [0:08:01]
 to clone. [0:08:02]
 This clones the profile now it's important to go back to the very first profile and hide [0:08:08]
 it by pressing the space bar. [0:08:10]
 Therefore we've got this profile here which I'm toggling the visibility of. [0:08:14]
 I'm just going to hide the other profile as well so we've just got this profile. [0:08:19]
 Now if I click on this clone you can see I've got a support and a map mode. [0:08:27]
 We can drag the profile inside the body so it can be used within this body. [0:08:32]
 Now the profile is inside the body that's positioned at so the map mode here is deactivated. [0:08:37]
 That's click on the button on the end and that's asking us to select a reference. [0:08:45]
 For the reference I'm going to select the vertex just here. [0:08:51]
 You can see the vertex has changed at the moment same translate origin which means that [0:08:56]
 the shape or the geometry has translated to the origin of that point. [0:09:00]
 It's still positioned around the wrong way so we need a second reference to attach this. [0:09:06]
 Make sure it's saying selecting if not just click on it and saying selecting there and [0:09:09]
 I'm going to click on this line. [0:09:12]
 The moment it's in error and that's because we got to pick normal to edge. [0:09:17]
 That means the sketch will point normal to that edge. [0:09:23]
 So the z axis of that sketch is now pointing along this line. [0:09:29]
 This is the z axis as in a local coordinate system after the sketch not the global coordinate [0:09:34]
 system by our two different things. [0:09:37]
 That's it okay. [0:09:39]
 Now we've got a profile within this body. [0:09:42]
 That's used that in sweep so let's come over to the part design. [0:09:48]
 Come over to the model tab and click the profile so our profile here. [0:09:56]
 Now to part design it's an additive feature. [0:09:59]
 It's a creative additive feature and additive pipe. [0:10:03]
 We've got the profile as the object and now we can add the edges. [0:10:09]
 All we can click on object and select the object that we want. [0:10:13]
 That's selected the whole object. [0:10:15]
 Let me so I don't have to add the individual edges. [0:10:18]
 So if I change this we don't have to come back into the additive pipe and update those [0:10:23]
 edges in our list. [0:10:25]
 Okay that now. [0:10:27]
 So now we've got our pipe running through here. [0:10:32]
 The idea of this is that we can add any time coming to our original profile and change [0:10:38]
 it and it will be reflected through our model. [0:10:43]
 The additive pipe has used a profile which is a clone of profile 1 which is here. [0:10:50]
 So if I come into profile 1 and change this by deleting the geometry within and I didn't [0:10:57]
 say a slot and closing everything gets updated. [0:11:10]
 This means I can add another body in here. [0:11:12]
 Let's create another body and go for the same process. [0:11:16]
 The body 1 is active so we're add a sketch. [0:11:20]
 I place it along the xy plane and okay and I'm just going to place just a simple lining [0:11:26]
 here off to the side. [0:11:30]
 As it close, now a line is added. [0:11:35]
 We're coming to the draw for a bench and we take profile 1 from our profile templates. [0:11:43]
 Now to modifications, clone and then drag that clone into our new body. [0:11:50]
 Now clones in the new body, I can take that profile and use the map mode at the moment. [0:11:55]
 It's sitting here. [0:11:57]
 Still in the original position. [0:11:59]
 So look at the map mode, click on the button the end. [0:12:03]
 Set the point on the new body and the second reference was slet the line and make sure [0:12:12]
 it's normal to edge. [0:12:18]
 Now let's normal to edge, that's okay that. [0:12:21]
 Can come back over to the part design. [0:12:26]
 Set the profile, I'm going to select different screen this time. [0:12:30]
 Create the pipe using the toolbar. [0:12:34]
 The object's been added. [0:12:35]
 Select the object and then add the object. [0:12:39]
 All we can add edges, I select in the edges if we want and hit okay. [0:12:46]
 Now we've got the two profiles in here. [0:12:48]
 We actually only got one because it's linked. [0:12:51]
 So our original profile can at any time be changed to what every one. [0:12:59]
 Let's go for a polyline and we'll just sketch something in here like so and hit close. [0:13:09]
 Both bodies have changed and our profiles have been used in both sections. [0:13:19]
 This means at any time we can go back and change our profiles and any clones that [0:13:23]
 will be made for those profiles can update in those bodies. [0:13:26]
 This really opens up the flexibility of creating parameter actually models with spreadsheets. [0:13:31]
 We have the customisation of the profile along with the configuration and customisation [0:13:36]
 for a spreadsheet. [0:13:38]
 We're going to be building such a model in our next video. [0:13:40]
