===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD for Beginners 31 - Parametric Spreadsheet and Master Sketch Workflow for Part Design =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of the [0:00:03]
 Learning Free Capital Beginners where I teach the fundamentals of free CAD from and begin [0:00:07]
 the perspective. [0:00:08]
 Today we're going to be looking at configurable and dynamic models. [0:00:12]
 In the forms of this gate where we have a parametric spreadsheet that drives the configuration [0:00:17]
 of the gate, also we've included a master sketch workflow where you can change the profiles [0:00:23]
 in total isolation to the model, allow those to take effect in the model itself. [0:00:29]
 I hope this helps you with basic parameters, spreadsheets and a master clone workflow for profiles. [0:00:35]
 Hope you enjoy this series and that's how to look at this technique. [0:00:39]

 For this example we're going to be creating a customizable grote and that's going to be the [0:01:07]
 custom isolation of the profiles and the configuration and size of the grotes itself. [0:01:14]
 That's start with a grote, so I'm going to create a new body and a new sketch, [0:01:19]
 along the x-y-blane and here okay. [0:01:24]
 And create two uprights for the size of the grotes and then a top section that goes across [0:01:35]
 here. [0:01:38]
 We're going to take the bottom points of the two uprights and place them symmetrical to [0:01:43]
 the center point by clicking on them and clicking on the last point which is the center point. [0:01:49]
 I'm using the symmetry constraint. [0:01:51]
 I'm going to do the same for the top section as well. [0:01:54]
 Taking these two points and the vertical axis and using symmetry. [0:02:04]
 I'm going to use a curve to join these two together to round off these edges. [0:02:15]
 Like so. [0:02:17]
 Make sure that these two curves have a quality across the radius. [0:02:24]
 So now we've got this model. [0:02:29]
 Why I'm going to do is take the curves and make these two tangent and the same for the [0:02:38]
 top as well. [0:02:43]
 And again on this side. [0:02:46]
 So we're using the tangent to the constraint. [0:02:50]
 We get a message to say about the substitution of the constraints. [0:02:54]
 We just okay that. [0:02:57]
 So now we've got this model. [0:03:00]
 Let's close that and start setting up our spreadsheet. [0:03:04]
 I want to control the heights of these lengths. [0:03:08]
 So this will probably be a length all the way up to here and a length going across the [0:03:12]
 top. [0:03:13]
 So we'll do that. [0:03:14]
 I start the spreadsheet by coming into the drop down and picking this spreadsheet [0:03:18]
 workbench. [0:03:19]
 We create a new spreadsheet or spreadsheet, a great spreadsheet. [0:03:24]
 And we can start adding our parameters in here. [0:03:27]
 So I'm adding the top length and a side length. [0:03:33]
 With that a top length of 500mm and a side length of 200mm. [0:03:41]
 Let's give these aylices by clicking on the 500 coming up to the aylis and typing in [0:03:49]
 top length. [0:03:53]
 Be careful the casing because the casing does matter as here enter. [0:03:59]
 And click off. [0:04:00]
 This should be colored now so we can see the aylis has taken effect. [0:04:04]
 Let's type in the next aylis for side length for the 200mm. [0:04:09]
 Make sure you hit enter and click off. [0:04:13]
 So we've got these two fields aylists. [0:04:15]
 Therefore we can use them in our sketch. [0:04:17]
 Let's come over to the sketch and double click it. [0:04:21]
 I'm going to set the top length here by using these two points because we've got [0:04:26]
 the curvature here and set a length. [0:04:35]
 There's a little button on the end to allow for a formula. [0:04:37]
 So click on the formula and type in spreadsheet. [0:04:41]
 Your spreadsheet will come up. [0:04:44]
 And then we have a dot and type in top length for capital T matching the case of the [0:04:51]
 lettering and you get the 500. [0:04:54]
 This is connected now to the spreadsheet. [0:04:56]
 You can see that's grayed out so it's connected. [0:04:59]
 Also the length at the top will become orange. [0:05:04]
 Just got that length in there. [0:05:05]
 Let's do the same for the top, this point and this point. [0:05:11]
 And set a height. [0:05:13]
 The guy he used in the putt on the end for the formula and typing in spreadsheet. [0:05:18]
 Pressing down our slits the ultimate list you've got the dot on the end which is important. [0:05:23]
 Type in side. [0:05:25]
 I'll do my own shows and press down our key to get to there and hit enter and okay. [0:05:32]
 When we okay that we got our legs set up and we can order this tangent here if we want. [0:05:40]
 That's that a radius in here. [0:05:42]
 So let's go back to the spreadsheet, hit close, come into the spreadsheet. [0:05:49]
 What radius? [0:05:53]
 And we'll set that for the time as 20. [0:05:57]
 Click on the field, give it an idea to top radius and hit enter. [0:06:04]
 Coming back to the sketch. [0:06:08]
 We can come over, select the top arc and add a radius in here. [0:06:16]
 The gains let's in the form of the button. [0:06:19]
 Type in a spreadsheet. [0:06:22]
 Top radius and hit enter and okay. [0:06:27]
 Now I've got that in there, everything's fully constrained. [0:06:30]
 Any changes to the spreadsheet. [0:06:32]
 If I close that, zoom it out, any changes to the spreadsheet. [0:06:41]
 We'll be reflected in the sketch. [0:06:49]
 Now we've got those, that start making the profiles. [0:06:52]
 I'm going to come over to the model tab and this body, I'm going to click on it, I'm [0:06:58]
 going to right click and click toggle active body. [0:07:02]
 This is not active now. [0:07:04]
 This means when I add items to the preview, they'll go underneath the body. [0:07:08]
 Rather than accidentally been placed inside. [0:07:11]
 It's fine if I get placed inside, we can drag them out. [0:07:15]
 Click on your document and right click. [0:07:19]
 Crake group. [0:07:21]
 A new group has been created. [0:07:23]
 This will be the templates. [0:07:25]
 So this is the profile templates. [0:07:29]
 Which is going to create one for the time being. [0:07:31]
 So that's come into the sketch up and create our first profile. [0:07:37]
 Make sure nothing is selected, so I've got nothing selected in the tree here. [0:07:40]
 This means when we click on the create sketch, it'll be added to one of the planes, [0:07:45]
 rather than attached to one of these items. [0:07:50]
 We're going to go for x, y and hit OK. [0:07:53]
 Make sure any profiles are sketched around this center point. [0:07:59]
 So for now, I'm just going to go for a simple circle in here, like so. [0:08:05]
 Let's go to the sketch and set the radius of this circle. [0:08:12]
 To around 50 millimeters. [0:08:15]
 We could hook this up to the spreadsheet, but we're going to be changing the shape of this [0:08:19]
 profile. [0:08:20]
 This is the reason why we kept them as templates. [0:08:23]
 So close that. [0:08:24]
 What will be happening is the spreadsheet will be controlling our greats and any amendments [0:08:29]
 to the profiles will be controlling the profile of that crates. [0:08:33]
 The material will around this great. [0:08:36]
 Let's rename this sketch. [0:08:40]
 Call it profile 1 and then drop the profile into the profile templates for the neatly inside [0:08:47]
 that group. [0:08:51]
 Now let's come over to the draft workbench. [0:08:56]
 Now in the draft workbench, we can come into the profile templates, click on the profile, [0:09:02]
 come out to modification and click on clone. [0:09:05]
 That's clones that profile. [0:09:07]
 You'll see it outside of that profile templates. [0:09:10]
 Make sure we click on the profile and press the space bar to hide it. [0:09:15]
 I can now drop this profile inside the body. [0:09:18]
 When we open up the body, we now got the profile. [0:09:21]
 That's attached this to this body. [0:09:24]
 Click on the profile. [0:09:26]
 Come down to the map mode and see it's deactivated. [0:09:29]
 Then click inside this field. [0:09:32]
 This is on the data tab and click on the button on the end. [0:09:38]
 Now select the vertex of this path. [0:09:43]
 You can see we've got it's selecting up here. [0:09:45]
 This isn't selecting. [0:09:47]
 Just click on the button and then click on the vertex. [0:09:52]
 At the moment it's translate origin. [0:09:54]
 That means sketch has translated over to this point. [0:09:58]
 This sketch itself hasn't translated. [0:10:00]
 It's clone. [0:10:01]
 That's actually translated to this point. [0:10:05]
 Reference 2 makes sure that's is saying it's selecting. [0:10:09]
 Now pick this line. [0:10:12]
 The edge of the path we want a sweep to follow. [0:10:17]
 You'll go into error and that's because we got to select no more to edge. [0:10:21]
 That flips that profile around so the z axis is in line with this edge. [0:10:26]
 So remember a sketch has only got two axis. [0:10:29]
 The z axis always runs away from the sketch. [0:10:32]
 We're dealing with local and global coordinate systems here. [0:10:36]
 That's okay now. [0:10:38]
 Now I've got the profile. [0:10:40]
 We can use that in the sweep. [0:10:42]
 It's going to hide the grid in with this button on the toolbar. [0:10:45]
 It's the grid in the gone. [0:10:47]
 Let's come back over to the part design. [0:10:51]
 Come to the model. [0:10:52]
 Make sure the profile is selected. [0:10:54]
 So this profile here. [0:10:56]
 This one is the path that we want it to follow. [0:10:59]
 So I'm just going to rename that. [0:11:05]
 Now select the profile. [0:11:08]
 We're going to be using the abs of pipe and then select the object for the path that [0:11:14]
 we want to sweep. [0:11:16]
 Which is this one. [0:11:17]
 That's what our path now. [0:11:19]
 And hit okay. [0:11:21]
 We've got the starts of our great, our parametric great. [0:11:25]
 That means that we can come into the spreadsheet anytime and change, say, the side length [0:11:30]
 to 300. [0:11:33]
 Come back and everything's changed. [0:11:37]
 So we've got to the point we have our outer structure, our spreadsheet and our templates [0:11:44]
 for the profiles. [0:11:47]
 We now want to cross and struts. [0:11:49]
 Let go across this way. [0:11:51]
 We want this totally configurable. [0:11:53]
 So we're going to create a sketch, but it's not going to be in the obvious way that we're [0:11:56]
 going to sketch this grid. [0:11:57]
 So make sure nothing's selected. [0:11:59]
 Make sure that the body is active. [0:12:02]
 Should be bold if not right click, toggle that to the body. [0:12:07]
 And create a sketch. [0:12:08]
 Place it along the xy plane and hit okay. [0:12:12]
 Now we don't need to create a line that's going to go here. [0:12:16]
 We want to keep it centered. [0:12:18]
 That's just place a single line centered in here. [0:12:23]
 We're going to control this by length and placement. [0:12:26]
 That's it, escape. [0:12:27]
 Get the mouse point back and set some length. [0:12:30]
 I'll come back to the length. [0:12:33]
 We insert it in length. [0:12:34]
 It's come to the form of editor. [0:12:36]
 We're going to use the spreadsheet and set it to side length. [0:12:43]
 And here, okay. [0:12:45]
 You can see that's gone all the way through and into this section. [0:12:52]
 We can see that if we close that, click on this pipe and press the space bar. [0:12:58]
 How that sits within there. [0:13:00]
 Now we've modeled this over the center point. [0:13:03]
 We need to move this across to this side to last place the structure across here. [0:13:10]
 We could have modeled this from the center point so the start of this here. [0:13:15]
 And then we wouldn't have to do this. [0:13:17]
 But as we come this far, that's how you resolve this. [0:13:21]
 Let's come into that new sketch and rename it. [0:13:24]
 I could call it vertical drop-off. [0:13:29]
 And now I'm going to take that and change the attachment offset. [0:13:35]
 The position and which wants to change it along the x. [0:13:39]
 So the x here. [0:13:41]
 Kind to the formula. [0:13:44]
 You can see that the minus value is taken as this way. [0:13:47]
 Because this is symmetrical around the center point, all we need to do is kind to the formula [0:13:52]
 and set the former to minus spreadsheet dot top length divided by two. [0:14:01]
 And here, okay. [0:14:03]
 That places it in that position there. [0:14:06]
 This will create a strut that's going along this way. [0:14:09]
 We don't want this. [0:14:11]
 We want to offset this forward. [0:14:14]
 Now I may want to offset it by the radius. [0:14:16]
 Therefore I would just sketch it upon this point. [0:14:19]
 But I might want to offset a bit more into here. [0:14:23]
 So the time being I can come back into the formula and add the spreadsheet dot top radius. [0:14:33]
 And here enter. [0:14:34]
 Now places that length along there. [0:14:38]
 We can define additional offset in the spreadsheet. [0:14:45]
 Add a value. [0:14:49]
 Change the a this. [0:14:53]
 Hit enter. [0:14:56]
 Go back to that strut and then add in that onto the formula. [0:15:10]
 Therefore we get some offset. [0:15:12]
 Now that's create our profile. [0:15:16]
 I'm going to use the same profile in our profile templates. [0:15:20]
 So we need to come over to the draft workbench once again. [0:15:24]
 Cut to modification and clone. [0:15:28]
 That will clone. [0:15:29]
 That's selected profile. [0:15:31]
 We can drag that profile into the body. [0:15:34]
 And then we can select the profile, select the map mode. [0:15:38]
 Click on the button on the end and select the vertex for the bottom. [0:15:44]
 Next, let's take the line and make sure it's same normal to edge. [0:15:50]
 So a profile points in the correct direction. [0:15:53]
 Let's hit OK. [0:15:55]
 Take the profile and over in the part design. [0:16:00]
 We're going to make sure the profile is selected and make the pipe. [0:16:06]
 So the additive pipe. [0:16:09]
 Profile selective the objects. [0:16:11]
 The next object that we want is this line. [0:16:14]
 It connects up. [0:16:15]
 So that's going to be a fine when it comes to a round across here. [0:16:18]
 Let's hit OK. [0:16:22]
 So that's there. [0:16:23]
 You can now go to the model and create a linear pattern of this pipe. [0:16:27]
 To do that, click the last action. [0:16:30]
 The additive pipe. [0:16:31]
 This highlights the whole lot. [0:16:33]
 It's actually going to take this as a single part and pattern it across here. [0:16:40]
 So click on the additive pipe. [0:16:43]
 Go to part design, apply a pattern and linear pattern. [0:16:49]
 Our linear pattern has applied. [0:16:51]
 You can see it's going in the right direction. [0:16:53]
 If the direction is incorrect, then we can change the direction here. [0:16:57]
 And the current is, let's put that to four and change the length to say 200. [0:17:07]
 And you can see how that's gone across there. [0:17:12]
 Let's hit OK. [0:17:14]
 And coming to that linear pattern. [0:17:16]
 I'm going to hook up the currencies and the length back to the spreadsheet. [0:17:21]
 So come to the spreadsheet. [0:17:24]
 And we're going to place horizontal count for the currencies as five and horizontal [0:17:31]
 spacing as 200. [0:17:35]
 As 200. [0:17:38]
 I'm going to use these labels as the other says. [0:17:43]
 I'm going to take an enter. [0:17:44]
 So I'm just copying the labels just the save time. [0:17:51]
 And now we can come back to the linear pattern. [0:17:55]
 Change the occurrences to the spreadsheet. [0:17:59]
 Horizontal count and length to spreadsheet. [0:18:13]
 Horizontal spacing. [0:18:18]
 To change those in the properties of the linear pattern. [0:18:23]
 So now we can go in and change the horizontal spacing. [0:18:28]
 And the current says to what we see for it. [0:18:34]
 So the next step is to create small gradient that runs this way. [0:18:43]
 It's basically repeating the process. [0:18:46]
 Just hide the linear pattern and come back into the original additive pipe. [0:18:51]
 Open that up and look at the path. [0:18:55]
 It's a new sketch. [0:18:58]
 XY plane. [0:19:00]
 And OK. [0:19:03]
 Remember it's tempting to place the line here. [0:19:07]
 But I'm going to place it at this point during this way. [0:19:12]
 I'm going to set that to the top length by coming in and adding the length. [0:19:19]
 Go into the form now and type in spreadsheet dot top length. [0:19:31]
 And hit OK. [0:19:32]
 OK once more. [0:19:34]
 And closing. [0:19:36]
 Now we set the adjustment of where this should be. [0:19:40]
 As change this to horizontal strut. [0:19:42]
 Horizontal strut path. [0:19:45]
 Come into the sketch and look at the attachment. [0:19:49]
 Not a placement because I'll be read only the attachment, the position. [0:19:54]
 And we can nudge the X. [0:19:55]
 See if we've got the right axis. [0:19:57]
 Which we have. [0:19:59]
 And we set the formula. [0:20:00]
 And we can spread sheet dot top length divided by two. [0:20:06]
 And make sure that's in the minus direction. [0:20:09]
 And hit OK. [0:20:12]
 So that's attached at this point, but offset to here. [0:20:16]
 Now for the y axis, we may need to add some offset if we want to leave. [0:20:20]
 Since space clear here. [0:20:22]
 That's add that to the spreadsheet. [0:20:25]
 So we've got the addition offset here. [0:20:28]
 And place 10mm in there. [0:20:38]
 Again, I'm going to use the label just to add this up with the OS. [0:20:43]
 Hit enter and making sure that this is colored. [0:20:48]
 Now come back to the power of magic gate. [0:20:52]
 Find our horizontal strut. [0:20:55]
 Come into the y. [0:20:58]
 And change this with an offset, spreadsheet dot, fielf set. [0:21:06]
 Hit OK. [0:21:07]
 And it's going to go in the correct direction. [0:21:09]
 And this is a case of repeating so we want the profile. [0:21:13]
 At the moment we're only using one profile. [0:21:15]
 We can add more in a moment. [0:21:19]
 Back to the draft workbench. [0:21:23]
 Change the modifications, clone, and drop the clone into the body. [0:21:30]
 We're going to connect the profile up to this line now. [0:21:33]
 If you want to, we can select this path and press the space bar to hide it. [0:21:39]
 That's let that profile and change the map mode. [0:21:44]
 Again, select in the vertex, the line, and then normal to edge and OK. [0:21:53]
 Come back over to the part design. [0:21:57]
 And though our linear pattern, the last actions hidden, that doesn't matter. [0:22:03]
 We can just take the profile, create the pipe, [0:22:09]
 click the object and add the object. [0:22:13]
 And hit OK. [0:22:16]
 We've got the pipe in there. [0:22:19]
 This is going to be down to profile and offset, [0:22:21]
 remember we've offset this slightly. [0:22:24]
 So we can come in and change the spreadsheet to offset it a bit more. [0:22:28]
 Like so. [0:22:33]
 And in this case, we're doing the linear pattern again. [0:22:35]
 So repeating the linear pattern up here with the spreadsheet [0:22:38]
 and adding the formulas to the linear pattern. [0:22:42]
 This time the linear pattern is going to go this way. [0:22:45]
 So you can see the horizontal sketch axis. [0:22:51]
 We need to reverse the direction to go the other way [0:22:56]
 and set a length. [0:23:00]
 And also set the occurrences. [0:23:02]
 Once we've got some in there, we can go back in to the spreadsheet [0:23:18]
 and add our parameters into the spreadsheet. [0:23:20]
 And finally, going back into the linear pattern, [0:23:36]
 and we'll clean up. [0:23:49]
 That's the properties. [0:24:10]
 Once we're happy, then we can decide if we want different profiles [0:24:15]
 for these struts here. [0:24:17]
 That's quite simple to do because we just come in and create a new profile. [0:24:21]
 So a great sketch. [0:24:23]
 It's going to go into the body, but we're going to move it outside the body in a moment. [0:24:27]
 So let's go X, Y, and OK. [0:24:30]
 That's coming and hide the linear pattern. [0:24:34]
 And create a very simple profile. [0:24:38]
 For this one, I'm going to use a square. [0:24:40]
 So a rectangle over this center point and sets the symmetry [0:24:47]
 between these points and we'll make all the sides equal. [0:24:52]
 So using these two sides, make those equal. [0:24:56]
 And we'll also set some length. [0:24:59]
 Round about five mil. [0:25:05]
 So we've got a new profile. [0:25:06]
 When I come out, I'm coming up to task and closing. [0:25:13]
 Our profile sits in the center there. [0:25:16]
 And we've got a new sketch here. [0:25:17]
 Let's change this to profile. [0:25:21]
 So this is profile two. [0:25:24]
 It's inside the body at the moment, which we don't want. [0:25:27]
 So drag it outside. [0:25:28]
 So take it and drag it onto the top project here. [0:25:32]
 That will move it outside. [0:25:33]
 And then we can drag it inside our template styrofoam. [0:25:38]
 Now we're going for the process of cloning this back in [0:25:42]
 to the linear pattern to use the greater linear pattern. [0:25:44]
 So this one here. [0:25:46]
 So we come into this. [0:25:48]
 You can see this has been done with the additive pipe. [0:25:51]
 And we've got the profile here. [0:25:52]
 We could clone it and replace it. [0:25:54]
 But the easiest thing to do is click on that profile. [0:25:58]
 That's being used this one here. [0:26:01]
 And change the object that it clones. [0:26:07]
 So you can see it's cloning sketch 0.01 profile one. [0:26:11]
 So we click on here. [0:26:13]
 Use the button on the end. [0:26:15]
 Clear. [0:26:16]
 And we'll find profile two in the list. [0:26:18]
 So this one here. [0:26:20]
 And here, OK. [0:26:23]
 Click off. [0:26:25]
 Edit. [0:26:27]
 Refresh. [0:26:30]
 And we can see the profile. [0:26:33]
 Let's take an effect. [0:26:36]
 Because we just changed the profile, we don't have to change [0:26:40]
 the placement or anything like that. [0:26:42]
 The profile was placed in the same way as the original one. [0:26:45]
 We just swap them in. [0:26:49]
 Let's do this one as well. [0:26:52]
 So for that one, we're going to come up and find. [0:26:57]
 Let's part of this linear pattern. [0:26:58]
 So I'm going to press the space button. [0:26:59]
 This linear pattern. [0:27:00]
 This will show that step and hide all the rest. [0:27:04]
 Let's come into this additive pipe. [0:27:07]
 This one here. [0:27:08]
 And we can see the profile within here. [0:27:11]
 So come down and look at the objects. [0:27:15]
 That's cloned. [0:27:17]
 Notice we still got the map mode here in the water edge. [0:27:19]
 And the support is just the object that we're cloning. [0:27:24]
 Click on that and change it from profile one to profile two. [0:27:29]
 So clear and click on profile two. [0:27:32]
 And here, OK. [0:27:34]
 Click off. [0:27:36]
 We need to refresh. [0:27:37]
 That's bring back the last action. [0:27:39]
 This one here. [0:27:43]
 Edit. [0:27:45]
 Refresh. [0:27:48]
 And that's taking effect. [0:27:51]
 So we have a parametric grid or a great. [0:27:57]
 That we can swap in and out the profiles. [0:27:59]
 We can change these profiles. [0:28:01]
 So we can come into profile one and change the say change [0:28:05]
 the diameter of this. [0:28:06]
 Bit too big. [0:28:07]
 Let's bring back to 10 mil and close. [0:28:12]
 We'll change in the radius. [0:28:14]
 So we'll change the radius of that. [0:28:16]
 And we can come in and change the count vertical count. [0:28:21]
 To five or the horizontal space in the set to a set to a ring there. [0:28:26]
 And we get our fully parametric grid. [0:28:35]
 Now we can modify and use in our applications. [0:28:38]
 It was a bit of a long tutorial. [0:28:40]
 But I hope that's open to your eyes the way you can use that spreadsheet [0:28:43]
 and profile templates to make your models more configurable and dynamic for you or your clients needs. [0:28:49]
 Thank you for watching and I'll see you again soon. [0:28:52]
