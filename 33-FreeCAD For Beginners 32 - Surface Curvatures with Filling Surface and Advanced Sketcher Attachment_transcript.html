===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners 32 - Surface Curvatures with Filling Surface and Advanced Sketcher Attachment =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to the channel and welcome back to a new episode of the Learning [0:00:04]
 Free Cafe for Beginners, we'll teach the fundamentals of free CAD from a beginner's perspective. [0:00:09]
 Whilst we learn workflows, today we're going to be looking at surfacing workflow and [0:00:13]
 carrying on with the techniques that we looked at in our previous video. [0:00:17]
 So the previous video was regarding a sketch attachment and using such attachments as the [0:00:22]
 OX Y attachment and how we would do that and basically getting our head around how that [0:00:29]
 attachment works. This video we're going to be using those line attachments in a surfacing workflow [0:00:34]
 and we're going to be attaching to like something like a base sketch by clicking on a number of [0:00:39]
 vertices and selecting a sketch and learning how to attach that with those certain attachments [0:00:44]
 to allows to control the curvature of something like this object. [0:00:50]
 So I hope you find it in all these tutorials useful and let's have a look at this technique. [0:00:56]

 I've got a new document freecat and I'm going to come over to the sketcher and start sketching [0:01:25]
 the basic geometry for our surface. We're looking down from the top so the x, y plane so you can see here [0:01:33]
 and I create new sketch along the x, y plane. All we're going to do is create some geometry in here. [0:01:40]
 I'm going to use a rounded rectangle. The reason why I'm using a rounded rectangle is because we have [0:01:47]
 these curves here that we can add a surface to. The idea is to take this shape and create [0:01:54]
 a curve shape for this so the bottom of the shape will be this rounded rectangle. [0:02:00]
 But the top will be curved up. So I'm going to make sure this is symmetrical to the centre [0:02:07]
 we don't have to do this and I'm not going to go too much into constraints because we're going to [0:02:12]
 move through this at a decent speed because we don't want to drill too much in locking down the full geometry. [0:02:19]
 I choose a symmetry constraint and I'm going to take these two points and the centre point [0:02:26]
 and just make those symmetrical. Now you can see we've got some constraints here. The horizontal constraints [0:02:33]
 I can click on that and delete that using a delete key and I'm going to pull the bottom out [0:02:39]
 just to make this shape a bit more interesting. Now if you think of it well we're looking [0:02:44]
 this type of shape. It could be a wing mirror or we could be looking at creating some kind of [0:02:51]
 say a window like a dome window or something like that. So we've got this shape here. [0:03:00]
 Let's close out and we're going to look at creating the surface across here. Now first thing I'm going [0:03:06]
 to do is let the sketch and actually come into the view. And this is really for purposes [0:03:13]
 demonstration so you can see the vertices and also makes it a lot easier to see the [0:03:19]
 vertices and actually slap them. It's I'm going to bring out the point size and this is under [0:03:25]
 the view tab and it's under object style. So we've got the point size there. We've also got the line width [0:03:34]
 so we can increase the line width if we want to as well. Now I'm going to attach a sketch [0:03:41]
 to this now. If we looked at our previous video where I started talking about the line [0:03:46]
 OX wire attachments, you notice that I created a sketch then attached it. This time we're [0:03:53]
 going to select the points that we want to attach to. We're going to go through this attachment [0:03:57]
 style in a moment as well. So we're going to look back at that video or we can get a rough [0:04:01]
 idea of the attachment style here and I'll leave a link in the description. So we're [0:04:06]
 going to select some vertices to attach the sketch to. I'm going to hover over the vertex [0:04:13]
 here and then I'm going to use the control key and I've held it down and hover over this [0:04:18]
 vertex. So we've got the two vertices selected there and now I'm going to create a sketch. [0:04:25]
 So create a new sketch. It's going to ask us about the sketch attachment. If we drop [0:04:30]
 this down we have got the OZX, OZY, etc. attachments here. Now remember in back to our previous [0:04:38]
 video because we selected only two references, two vertices. Then we're only interested [0:04:45]
 in the first two of here. If we select the free then we use all free. So O is the origin of the [0:04:54]
 sketch we're attaching. So that'd be the middle point of the sketch where the axis is [0:04:59]
 cross. So that will attach the first reference. The second one is the direction in which the [0:05:06]
 sketch will be pointing. So because we haven't got a Z on the sketch that's always normal. [0:05:11]
 So that runs in and out of the sketch. So I'm going to pick OXY and hit OK. So you can see that [0:05:23]
 if we've attached the origin to our first selection and the X of the sketch that runs along [0:05:30]
 here is attached to our second reference, the second vertex. You can see that we're actually [0:05:37]
 laying flat on this sketch but that's actually fine because we can rotate this sketch [0:05:42]
 in a moment. I'm going to use the external geometry tool or come up to sketch, sketch [0:05:49]
 on the geometry and you'll see the external geometry tool in here and here. And we'll [0:05:54]
 select this vertex and bring it in. Our next going to add an arc between these two points. [0:06:03]
 Right. So now we don't want to pull in these two vertices yet and add an arc because [0:06:12]
 we're going to rotate this. This one here is going to rotate around this point. We start [0:06:18]
 adding in an arc on this side. Then when we rotate this arc will come up this way and we [0:06:25]
 won't get the effect that we want. So let's close that and look at that sketch. This is going [0:06:31]
 to be my profile of the surface. So if I right click and rename this is the surface profile. [0:06:38]
 It won't be the exact profile. It just keeps the surface under control. It's really a [0:06:44]
 constraint against the surface so it'll stop the surface going beyond this curve. At the [0:06:51]
 moment it's laying flat. So we need to rotate that. So click on the surface. Make sure you're [0:06:56]
 on the data tab and if we come down we can see we've got the attachment and the angle. And [0:07:05]
 if we rotate this you can see well it's rotating around the wrong axis. So instead of back [0:07:13]
 to zero and I'm going to come up to the map mode which is Oxy and click on the free dots [0:07:20]
 on the end. Now I can scroll down to the bottom and use the around X around y around Z. Now [0:07:29]
 these relate to the sketch axis. So if I go around X this is the X the sketch that runs [0:07:37]
 this way. At the moment we're on the Xy plane so it will align with our global [0:07:42]
 coordinate system. If it wasn't a different plane then it will be different. The Z axis [0:07:50]
 here runs in and out of the sketch. So if I rotate it like 45 degrees this way if I added [0:08:00]
 some set direction not around Z then the Z of the sketch is actually normal to this [0:08:07]
 sketch but we must remember that we've rotated it around this way so the Z is actually [0:08:14]
 this direction. So we can see that when I go in the Z direction it will move upwards. [0:08:26]
 We don't want any direction we want to attach these points. Let's come up and here [0:08:32]
 we've now attached our sketch. Let's do the other two points. So select one, control [0:08:45]
 select the other, new sketch and we pick remember it's just the first two because we've [0:08:55]
 got two references. So it would be OXZ connecting to the origin and running along the X of [0:09:03]
 the sketch. Let's okay that. And then add a curve and pull in the geometry and attach [0:09:20]
 it to that. Now we've got our arc that's close and again that's rotate this. Let's [0:09:29]
 come around and if we look at our previous sketch it's click on it so surface profile and [0:09:36]
 it can't down to the attachment and look at the axis. You can see we've got a one in the [0:09:40]
 X so we're rotating around the X here. If you look at our sketch and this is the reason [0:09:46]
 why it wouldn't rotate in the right direction is that our axis is actually rotating around [0:09:52]
 the Z. That's what happened here. It actually rotated around that Z axis. So we can [0:09:59]
 either do one of two things we could zero out the Z and put it one in the X and rotate it [0:10:06]
 that way or I'll zero that out. Here we have the sketch using the map mode again and [0:10:17]
 come down and we look at the attachment offset. See it's saying local coordinates here so [0:10:22]
 this is local coordinate system of the sketch and we rotate around the X. So once we've [0:10:31]
 got them rotated then we can close out here okay and we're denying this to surface [0:10:39]
 profile too. This sketch here the bottom one is our base sketch which will create the surface [0:10:47]
 against. Assuming I have a look what we got so we've got our base sketch and we're going [0:10:58]
 to create a surface on this base sketch. To do that I'm going to use the surface workbench [0:11:05]
 over in the drop down and come down to surface and we're going to be using something called [0:11:10]
 a fill in surface so this one here so click on the fill in surface and add the edges and we [0:11:16]
 move around all the edges and we need to do this in sequence so we can't click here and [0:11:25]
 then click this one because well it won't work we have to do them in sequence. I just remove [0:11:31]
 those two using remove edge and then add edge gain and add the edges in and see the surface [0:11:38]
 is starting to fill as you move around. We're not going to touch these arcs yet which is going [0:11:45]
 to fill the bottom surface on this option. Now if we come down we see the edge constraints. [0:11:53]
 So this constraints the surface against these edges and this is how we make our curvature [0:12:02]
 so add edge and then click the edges that constraint our surface like so. The surface [0:12:13]
 was flat because it was a planner object originally that means all the vertices are on the [0:12:19]
 same plane therefore flat surface. When we add the arcs to this surface has constraints then [0:12:26]
 we start getting the curvature. So at the moment we've added the arcs in here that's have a [0:12:31]
 look to see what happens when we start moving these arcs. Now the good thing is is that we have [0:12:38]
 got the arcs in the attachment we've got the angle set up against the right axis and that [0:12:48]
 was determined by the attachment mode. If we look at this in profile we can see what we've got. We [0:12:56]
 can see how the surface comes up and it's constrained with the arc and the same on this side [0:13:02]
 the surface comes up and it's constrained for the arc. So it keeps these surfaces in check. [0:13:07]
 It's a quick on surface too and what I'm going to do is come down and change the angle and at the [0:13:16]
 same time I'm going to go to edits and refresh which is control R on Ubuntu it'll be different [0:13:23]
 some windows it'll be different on Mac so I'm going to use control R each time I press the up [0:13:29]
 R key so I'm pressing the up arrow key control R and you can see how that arc is constrained in that [0:13:37]
 surface. Notice the continuity of the surface so basically we've got an arc between these two points [0:13:47]
 like so and the constraining edges we've added to that constrains the arc between these two surfaces. [0:13:55]
 So we're changing the angle right up to say here you can see that surface is being constrained [0:14:09]
 but we're still trying to make an arc between these two so bring this right over so it's in this [0:14:17]
 angle it can travel or you can see how that surface is being under constrained so it can just [0:14:23]
 produce the arc that it wants to produce if I move both of these arcs out the way so this one here [0:14:31]
 and bring this right way around so go over in this direction hit control R you can see what's happening [0:14:39]
 so we're getting this arc between both these points so we can make this curvature in say like a [0:14:51]
 panel or something like that the more arcs we add to the say we added a center arc then that will [0:14:56]
 constrain the center of this surface so that's bringing the arcs right in and same on this side [0:15:12]
 so we've got this surface here if we take the profiles and pull the profiles out [0:15:28]
 the first idea is to zoom out and find the center of the arc which is down here somewhere let's bring this [0:15:34]
 up let's start pulling those out like so and hit close you can see what's happening let's do the [0:15:48]
 other one the arcs are getting more towards a spherical shape and our surface starts moving out [0:16:07]
 what's to follow those arcs and again we have control over that surface so we're creating this [0:16:23]
 dome effect here so if you're looking to surface such things as a swing top bin then this is the [0:16:32]
 route that you could go if the surface looks of low quality remember about this could be down to the [0:16:39]
 deviation settings also we have surface settings as well so we've got the degrees here so I can play with [0:16:51]
 this degrees and get some different effects on the surface if we got some problems with it [0:16:59]
 I normally bring the degree right down the deviation for the surface if we look at view we can see the [0:17:08]
 deviation on here and the object style changes to 0.05 and you can see how that surface has cleaned up [0:17:18]
 now when it comes to something like creating a second skin for the surface so this is the first skin [0:17:26]
 first wall and we want to create a solid from this because at the moment this would be a shell [0:17:33]
 because we only got one wall then we would come over to say the part and you some it called an offset [0:17:43]
 or part 3D offset and you can see what's happening there it's actually 3D offset in it so we can [0:17:51]
 increase that offset to where we want so let's go say 6 it's pushed the offset outwards [0:17:59]
 but if we look from the front we can see it's not in line [0:18:06]
 minus 6 goingwards and fill to make the internal but this is not a plan of surface that's placed around there [0:18:18]
 we get this offset surface like goes this way and if we okay that with the fill then we've got [0:18:30]
 basically an uneven surface that runs around here we could say come in and create a shaping here [0:18:40]
 and cut it from here so we get a nice plan of face that we can use or if I go into the [0:18:48]
 offset and just delete that and we look at our bait sketch this one here and we're going to do [0:18:56]
 here's a little trick we look where it is and we use the astrude and I'm going to extrude it [0:19:03]
 by say 2mm so extrude this upwards but it's the solidest route that's come back to the astrude [0:19:13]
 and look at the data tab and see where says solid so that to false if I click off you'll see [0:19:26]
 we've created a very small lip that runs around there because we got this route it's actually [0:19:32]
 extruded downwards which we don't want because if I try to create a Boolean game series it's a part [0:19:40]
 Boolean and union and yes we get some obscure results it's coming in just delete that fusion [0:19:51]
 and use the astrude and I can see it's gone downwards because we've got an overlay there and [0:19:57]
 I'm going to come in and make this minus one so it's going the other way now when I take the [0:20:06]
 surface and the astrude and use the union so I'm going to use the toolbar this time for the union [0:20:11]
 and click yes we can see those union together we've got no errors in there now click the fusion [0:20:20]
 and create the offset the free the offset I'm going to use the toolbar this time [0:20:25]
 and notes when we look at this you can see that we've got a free the offset that runs all away [0:20:35]
 around here to you can see in here and you're free offset and that's set this to say [0:20:48]
 five millimeters that's gone outwards you can see we still got this as planar in here [0:20:54]
 so if I come down to the right you can see we've got a nice planar surface so if I go for the fill [0:21:03]
 it's all filled in there absolutely fine this jackness is deviation which we can change or set [0:21:15]
 permanently up in our preferences so edit preferences we can set the deviation in there I've got [0:21:22]
 videos about that if you want to go find that on my channel if go minus five let's go zimbans as well [0:21:28]
 and I hear okay remember if we're doing an offset that inside we'll have the fusion [0:21:36]
 and that's actually displayed so we need to press the space bar and that fusion to get rid of it [0:21:41]
 now we've got our surface I'm going to control select the surface profiles and press the space bar [0:21:50]
 and I'm just going to neat this up I come into the view and set the deviation to 0.05 [0:21:56]
 and we've got this nice surface which we can add Boolean effects to [0:22:04]
 so we're going to add shapes say this fear and make it where if a size we want [0:22:14]
 transform it [0:22:22]
 and create a cut between these two or a Boolean so I'm going to go for a cut [0:22:33]
 so cut that away from inside there now we're going to have the free the offset tool [0:22:41]
 sometimes it doesn't work so you have to find an alternative route to create that [0:22:46]
 thickness for the object there are a number of options and we're going to be visiting those in [0:22:52]
 a future video so I hope you enjoy this video I hope to see you again soon [0:22:55]
