===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners 33 -  Gear Assembly, Animation and Export to Video File =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of Learning [0:00:04]
 FreeCalfa Beginners teaching the fundamentals of freecat whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:09]
 Today we're going to be looking at an assembly for animation workflow with video output. [0:00:16]
 So in front of you we're animating and meshing a set of gears. [0:00:20]
 We're going to be building this simple assembly in freecat and then finally output in [0:00:26]
 assembly as an MP4, all within freecat to allow us to view the animation via a video. [0:00:37]
 Now this will require the assembly for workbench to be installed and from there we can actually [0:00:43]
 do our assembly, create it in freecat, animate it and output it or in the same workbench. [0:00:50]
 So I hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a look at this technique. [0:00:55]

 For this tutorial we're going to be using the part design. [0:01:23]
 I've already created a new document, I'll make that workbench here. [0:01:27]
 I'm going to first create a body and then I can come up to part design and create an [0:01:33]
 influ-gear. [0:01:35]
 This create a gear in the middle of the screen with a default as 26th. [0:01:41]
 We can change the default here to what everyone is going to do. [0:01:44]
 I'm going to go to this as 26th of the moment. [0:01:47]
 I'm going to hit OK. [0:01:49]
 What's happened is the influ-gear has been placed inside the body. [0:01:52]
 This can be used as a sketch so we can pad this up and I'm going to go for about [0:01:58]
 10mm. [0:01:59]
 Just keep it in the defaults and now I'm just going to rename that body as gear 1. [0:02:08]
 Now I've got the gear what we're going to do is select the top face and I'm going to add [0:02:12]
 a local corn system to this. [0:02:14]
 This will allow me to attach this in my assembly. [0:02:18]
 The corn system is a datamar jet and these are found here on the toolbar. [0:02:24]
 So we've got the datam plane, the axis, the datam point and the local corn system. [0:02:29]
 Also the variable in part design create a local corn system. [0:02:34]
 Local corn system will be added along the xyplane on the face we selected and just hit OK. [0:02:41]
 You notice we get a small axis handler that's been added to that face. [0:02:46]
 This will match up with the assembly once we import this in. [0:02:50]
 We're going to do the same but with another body to create a new body and I'm just going [0:02:55]
 to hide the previous gear so this previous body just pressing the space bar you notice [0:02:59]
 that new body is bold. [0:03:01]
 If it's not bold just right click toggle active body or double click it. [0:03:08]
 This means that when we create another influ-gear it's placed within that new body. [0:03:15]
 This one we're going to just kind of half the amount of teeth so 13 and hit OK. [0:03:22]
 We're going to rename this to gear 2. [0:03:26]
 We're going to mesh these gears in a moment. [0:03:31]
 Take note of when we look at the pad you can see this one's called influ-gear and this [0:03:36]
 one's called influ-gear 0.01. [0:03:39]
 This is important to come to creating our formula that links these together. [0:03:45]
 You can rename these if you want. [0:03:48]
 So I'm going to call this influ-gear 2 and this one right click rename influ-gear 1. [0:04:03]
 So they match the names of the body. [0:04:06]
 We're going to pad influ-gear 2 again at 10mm here OK. [0:04:13]
 You notice I've been added over sketch is upon here you can if you want you can create [0:04:18]
 a hole for say an axle to go through. [0:04:21]
 We'll keep in this simple because we're looking at animation and output of animation [0:04:24]
 in this assembly. [0:04:26]
 So going on click this face and add a local core system this time. [0:04:30]
 We're going to use the toolbar and make sure it's attached xy on plane. [0:04:37]
 OK that's now we've got gear 1 and gear 2. [0:04:41]
 That's hide gear 2. [0:04:44]
 We're going to save this. [0:04:45]
 I'm going to create a new folder and I'm just going to put it inside here as gear assembly. [0:04:59]
 Or something like that. [0:05:01]
 These bodies are going to leave hidden for the time being. [0:05:06]
 But now I'm going to create an assembly over the assembly for web-enge in the same file. [0:05:12]
 If you haven't got this web-enge installed just come up to the tools add-on-munger and you'll [0:05:17]
 be able to find in there. [0:05:19]
 Now we've got the assembly for web-enge open that she used this icon to create a new model [0:05:24]
 or assembly. [0:05:25]
 What happened is the gear parts will be placed in a parts folder or a parts group. [0:05:32]
 You can see the gears within here. [0:05:35]
 Still hidden. [0:05:36]
 And we've got the model. [0:05:38]
 It has a local core system which will be attaching to. [0:05:42]
 And it has something called variables which we're going to be using. [0:05:46]
 And a number of other folders in there. [0:05:49]
 That's start important parts to do that. [0:05:51]
 We use the import part icon here or the assembly and come in to import. [0:05:58]
 Now, now we've got our parts already in this document. [0:06:02]
 This allows us to import from the current document into the model or from a file. [0:06:08]
 I'm importing from the current document. [0:06:10]
 So I'm going to first import gear one. [0:06:13]
 When we insert this into the file, what will happen in each will get a pane on the other side. [0:06:18]
 Or a panel. [0:06:20]
 And it's same which selected link I've selected. [0:06:24]
 In brackets, it's got the name here, gear one. [0:06:26]
 The ID changes because it's created a link copy into the model. [0:06:32]
 It's going to ask us where to attach it to. [0:06:35]
 And we need to attach it to the part assembly. [0:06:38]
 Because this is our first part we've placed in there. [0:06:40]
 We've got nothing else that's attached to it too. [0:06:42]
 And once we've selected that, you can see we've got the LCS [0:06:46]
 on one side of the part and the LCS on the other side. [0:06:50]
 You notice we get a ghost in of the cog. [0:06:54]
 As it's attached to the LCS. [0:06:56]
 And we've got other x and y. [0:06:58]
 Z translations here. [0:07:02]
 We could have created, say, some kind of mount for this gear. [0:07:07]
 Import it in the mount. [0:07:09]
 And the mount would have say two LCS systems. [0:07:12]
 And we can add one on the other because we can add two in there. [0:07:15]
 And we just attach the gear either side. [0:07:18]
 But I'm just going to use a simple gear in this and attach it to this assembly. [0:07:24]
 This is attached now. [0:07:26]
 Hit no, okay, you'll see the gear has been placed in here. [0:07:30]
 This is the reason why we made these invisible. [0:07:33]
 Because if we click on the gear, so gear one, the process space bar, [0:07:38]
 you can see that we have two in here. [0:07:41]
 But it's been imported in. [0:07:43]
 You can see where this has been moved as well. [0:07:45]
 Remember we attached an LCS to the face. [0:07:48]
 And when it attached to the assembly, the LCS is match each other. [0:07:54]
 So this drops down. [0:07:56]
 The process space bar on that. [0:07:58]
 And import another gear into the system. [0:08:02]
 So taking this gear, we're going to import into the model. [0:08:05]
 Again, using the import from the import part. [0:08:10]
 This time, I'm going to use the toolbar. [0:08:12]
 And pick the second. [0:08:15]
 Hit insert. [0:08:17]
 And exactly the same. [0:08:18]
 See it's ghosted. [0:08:20]
 And we want to attach to. [0:08:22]
 And we're going to attach it to the part assembly. [0:08:24]
 Notice we got the other gear here as well. [0:08:26]
 So if we're adding parts into this, we've got the option to attach it to another part. [0:08:31]
 I'm just going to use the parent assembly again. [0:08:34]
 And I'm going to use LCS origin. [0:08:36]
 I'll type parent assembly. [0:08:38]
 Watch the ghosting. [0:08:39]
 It will move down. [0:08:41]
 And I'm going to use the X translation. [0:08:44]
 And we're going to move this across. [0:08:46]
 Press the up key. [0:08:48]
 And we're going to place it within here. [0:08:51]
 Now, these have meshed within here. [0:08:54]
 So what I'm going to do to make my life a bit harder. [0:08:58]
 And also make it easier on you. [0:09:00]
 If you come across this is that I'm going to place it here. [0:09:04]
 And also I'm going to place some Y translation. [0:09:07]
 So they don't mesh properly. [0:09:11]
 Something like this. [0:09:13]
 So we've got an overlap there. [0:09:14]
 And we're going to sort this out in our function. [0:09:16]
 Let's hit OK. [0:09:18]
 They have been added to the screen. [0:09:21]
 And on the left hand side, you can see gear 003 and gear 004 in the assembly. [0:09:26]
 As we roll over, you can see them highlighted in the right hand side here. [0:09:30]
 Let's give it a self-ciplter room. [0:09:34]
 Now we can start adding the formulas to these. [0:09:38]
 And we're going to start using inside the pad. [0:09:44]
 This infillut gear 1. [0:09:47]
 The original because this has the number of teeth on here. [0:09:52]
 So we look down in the properties on the data tab. [0:09:56]
 And we'll bring this across. [0:09:58]
 We can see a number of teeth. [0:09:59]
 So we're going to find the ratios between these. [0:10:02]
 But first, we need to drive this by something. [0:10:06]
 So these are going to turn and I'm going to mesh together. [0:10:10]
 For that, we're going to use something called a variable. [0:10:12]
 Now our variable is something that we can use to attach a value 2 that we can change. [0:10:19]
 And it has our new miracle string A this. [0:10:23]
 It's a great variable. [0:10:25]
 And we come up to here. [0:10:27]
 We do variables. [0:10:28]
 Or we come up to the assembly and then add variable. [0:10:32]
 I normally show it on the toolbar and then show it on the actual menu system. [0:10:36]
 Because when you look at the menu system, it doesn't normally move. [0:10:39]
 We'll tool bars these, come move around. [0:10:42]
 Type float is fine. [0:10:44]
 Flowing point number. [0:10:45]
 And we're going to give it a name. [0:10:47]
 I'm just going to call it rotate. [0:10:49]
 And we set the value. [0:10:51]
 I'm zero. [0:10:52]
 We can add a description if we want to have any other information in there. [0:10:56]
 Just going to hit OK. [0:10:58]
 On the left hand side, you see what we have these variables here. [0:11:02]
 If we click on them. [0:11:04]
 Inside we have the variable that's been added to our model. [0:11:08]
 That's use of variable to drive this cog. [0:11:12]
 To do that, we come down to the cog itself. [0:11:16]
 Now believe this is Gears 0.0 or 3. [0:11:19]
 If you look at the link object, it's actually gear 1. [0:11:23]
 Looking here, we want to drive the placement of the angle. [0:11:26]
 This one here. [0:11:27]
 So if I move this angle, you'll notice nothing's moving. [0:11:32]
 But angle doesn't move. [0:11:34]
 Let's go to the formula. [0:11:37]
 And what we're going to do in here is just type in variables. [0:11:44]
 And then dot, which is all to our place then. [0:11:48]
 If I start type in R, you'll see we've got rotate here. [0:11:52]
 So we've added the variable in there. [0:11:55]
 OK. [0:11:56]
 This angle is now linked to that variable. [0:12:00]
 Let's drive the animation of this cog. [0:12:04]
 To do this, we're going to use the two cogs up here. [0:12:07]
 This has got nothing to do with it. [0:12:09]
 We've actually put on screen. [0:12:10]
 It's just a button. [0:12:12]
 And that's the icon in the button. [0:12:13]
 We're just using the two cogs. [0:12:15]
 So this is animate assembly. [0:12:16]
 If I click on that, we get this window appear. [0:12:21]
 The document already, and we can select a variable. [0:12:24]
 Notice it's saying only floats. [0:12:25]
 We've got a float variable which we've used. [0:12:28]
 So this is fine. [0:12:29]
 So we can use the rotate. [0:12:31]
 It has a range begin and a range end. [0:12:35]
 Now let's place the range end in here of say 360. [0:12:40]
 Step size is how quickly it's going to go through this range. [0:12:46]
 So in steps of one each time. [0:12:49]
 And we've got loop and pendulum here which we can use. [0:12:53]
 So we've got that there. [0:12:54]
 Let's run the animation. [0:12:56]
 See what happens. [0:12:57]
 When we hit run, you can see the animation runs and the cog starts turning. [0:13:01]
 We can stop this at any time. [0:13:04]
 Change our variables, change the range, etc. [0:13:07]
 Let's close this and rig up this cog now. [0:13:12]
 You notice that the angle has changed to 240. [0:13:17]
 At any time we can come into our variables. [0:13:19]
 Click on here and change this to zero. [0:13:22]
 Here, enter. [0:13:24]
 And this is now changed back. [0:13:27]
 Or we can come up to animation or come up to assembly and down to animate assembly. [0:13:34]
 And bring this right down back to zero. [0:13:38]
 And close up. [0:13:41]
 So there's two ways of resetting that variable in there. [0:13:45]
 Let's click on the alpha gear. [0:13:47]
 So this one here, select it from the screen. [0:13:50]
 And we'll come down to the placement of that gear. [0:13:53]
 At the moment we'll select to the pad. [0:13:55]
 We need to select the body. [0:13:57]
 Placement is a ways on the body. [0:13:59]
 This is what we should be animating. [0:14:01]
 Again, come into the placement and come into the angle. [0:14:04]
 Grain if we change this, nothing happens. [0:14:07]
 And if we click off, it gets set back to zero. [0:14:11]
 So that's changes angle. [0:14:14]
 And use the form layer to turn into a special on the end. [0:14:18]
 So now we need to compare these two and find the ratio. [0:14:22]
 Obviously this is half a size, so it's going to be 0.5. [0:14:25]
 We divide these two together and then 0.5. [0:14:29]
 Depending on which way we round we do it, 0.5 or two. [0:14:32]
 So we're looking half the ratio. [0:14:35]
 Let's add the formula. [0:14:37]
 So if we do influence and we're looking for envelope gear 1, [0:14:43]
 that's just type that in. [0:14:46]
 You can see we've got the envelope gear 1 here in the double-shapfronts. [0:14:53]
 And number of teeth. [0:14:55]
 And we have the number of teeth. [0:14:57]
 And most 26. [0:14:58]
 And divide that by envelope gear 2. [0:15:04]
 And then we get our two. [0:15:08]
 The reason why I've done this is if any of these change sizes, [0:15:12]
 then we have that ratio in there. [0:15:14]
 We could just use the two. [0:15:16]
 If we're not going to change the size, [0:15:18]
 but this adds for the flexibility of the model. [0:15:21]
 At the beginning, I'm going to go variables. [0:15:25]
 Rotate times. [0:15:28]
 And then we have the rest of the formula. [0:15:31]
 So we've got variables. Rotate times. [0:15:34]
 If the gear 1. number of teeth divided by envelope gear 2. [0:15:37]
 number of teeth. [0:15:38]
 Now here, okay. [0:15:39]
 So these are now joined. [0:15:41]
 So this gear is joined by a formula. [0:15:45]
 And let's go to gear 0.4. [0:15:48]
 And you can see the formaries in here. [0:15:50]
 And this one is... [0:15:52]
 And this one is... [0:15:54]
 And this one is... [0:15:57]
 And this one is... [0:16:01]
 driven by just... [0:16:04]
 the formula for the rotation. [0:16:07]
 Now, one's going to rotate one way. [0:16:11]
 So one's going to rotate clockwise. [0:16:14]
 We want the other one to rotate anti-clockwise. [0:16:17]
 Also, we've got some offset to deal with here. [0:16:19]
 And we do that in a minute. [0:16:21]
 That's just animate the assembly and see what happens. [0:16:24]
 So click on an amate. [0:16:26]
 We still got the 0 to 360. [0:16:29]
 And trying to place it somewhere where we can see what's going on. [0:16:32]
 There we go. [0:16:34]
 Let's hit run. [0:16:35]
 So this one is actually rotating anti-clockwise. [0:16:38]
 And this one's got to rotate clockwise. [0:16:41]
 So we need to... [0:16:43]
 play with the rotation. [0:16:44]
 So that's... [0:16:45]
 Stop that. [0:16:46]
 We've still got the mesh in as well to do as well. [0:16:48]
 So that's bring this back and close it. [0:16:51]
 So first of all, that's... [0:16:53]
 this rotation. [0:16:54]
 So let's click on this one. [0:16:56]
 Here's 0 to 4. [0:16:59]
 Back into the placement angle. [0:17:02]
 And it's as simple as going into here and placing a minus on here. [0:17:07]
 Okay. [0:17:08]
 And let's see what happens now. [0:17:11]
 They're now moving in the correct direction. [0:17:14]
 And we need to deal with the mesh in. [0:17:16]
 So stop that. [0:17:19]
 And set this back to 0 or we can zero off the variable. [0:17:24]
 Now to set the mesh in, that's how we look. [0:17:27]
 See what we got. [0:17:28]
 So that's coming to this one. [0:17:31]
 And come back down to the gear. [0:17:34]
 So gear zero zero for the body. [0:17:37]
 And where we've got the angle and the formula. [0:17:42]
 And we need to add at the beginning. [0:17:46]
 So I'm going to go for 14 in here. [0:17:51]
 And plus the minus variable rotation. [0:17:55]
 And that's okay that. [0:17:57]
 And that's quick. [0:18:00]
 On the animation we can see this is refreshed and spun round. [0:18:03]
 So that looks about right and hit run. [0:18:05]
 And now they're meshing together. [0:18:08]
 We need to do a little bit more on there. [0:18:11]
 But they're all meshing together fine. [0:18:12]
 That's stop that. [0:18:15]
 So we have our animation. [0:18:20]
 Now how do we output this as say a video file or an animated gift? [0:18:29]
 Well because we're in the assembly for this allows us to animate and output as a video. [0:18:35]
 We're going to use the same icon again. [0:18:38]
 The animate assembly. [0:18:40]
 And you'll see a save here. [0:18:43]
 So that's reset this back and hit save. [0:18:50]
 So it's saying the animation preview is ready. [0:18:57]
 And we've got this here. [0:19:00]
 And that's just minimized that down. [0:19:03]
 And you can see we've got the previous scale. [0:19:06]
 It's got a little icon in here which we can get right off. [0:19:09]
 So the logo here. [0:19:10]
 You see it's pulling it in here. [0:19:12]
 We can pull in another logo. [0:19:14]
 Or that's try that and delete it out. [0:19:18]
 And I hit select again just to get rid of that. [0:19:26]
 So that's gone now. [0:19:28]
 We can change the background color as well. [0:19:31]
 If we want to do it, I'm just going to leave that off. [0:19:33]
 Got the width. [0:19:35]
 The frames per second. [0:19:36]
 And we select a file. [0:19:38]
 And how many loops as well, which is quite handy. [0:19:40]
 So let's file. [0:19:41]
 We've got the sporty file types down here. [0:19:43]
 So we've got all those there. [0:19:45]
 And we're just going to set this. [0:19:47]
 It's going into the gears project. [0:19:49]
 As gears. [0:19:51]
 Animation. [0:19:53]
 And we need to specify a file type. [0:19:57]
 So dot MP4. [0:20:00]
 And save. [0:20:02]
 And we'll come down and create and save. [0:20:05]
 FreeCAD is now taking the animation and rendering it for us. [0:20:10]
 So it's capturing an export and the animation. [0:20:13]
 So what we do is leave that and come back in a moment and see what we get at the end of it. [0:20:18]
 If we bring back. [0:20:24]
 Animation assembly. [0:20:26]
 We can see that this is running. [0:20:28]
 So just bolt back the window because I minimized it. [0:20:32]
 It's pulled back the window here. [0:20:34]
 You can see it's increasing. [0:20:36]
 And now. [0:20:38]
 Animation is finishing. [0:20:40]
 And let's like we'll done. [0:20:41]
 So let's close this. [0:20:44]
 Close the animation. [0:20:46]
 So looking back at the file system. [0:20:48]
 For some reason I put in my downloads. [0:20:49]
 We've got the gears project here. [0:20:51]
 And then open up the gear animation. [0:20:53]
 Open up the application. [0:20:55]
 And I'm going to pick the VLC Media Player. [0:20:58]
 And we've got animation here. [0:21:00]
 So it's all we're exported out. [0:21:01]
 It's all working. [0:21:03]
 And that's basically it. [0:21:04]
 So that's an assembly. [0:21:06]
 Using gears from the Influred Gears. [0:21:09]
 Connecting those both up with ratios and a variable to allow for the movements between those. [0:21:15]
 And machine the gears together. [0:21:16]
 And finally exporting those out as an animation. [0:21:21]
