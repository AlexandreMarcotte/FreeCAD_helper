===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners 34 -  Part Design Shape Binder vs Sub Shape Binder =====
 Hi everyone, welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of the Learning [0:00:04]
 FreeCalf of Beginners where we're teaching the fundamentals of freecad from and begins [0:00:07]
 perspective whilst we learn workflows. Today we're going to be looking at the part design [0:00:12]
 workbench, the shape binder and the subject binder. We're going to be understanding how they [0:00:18]
 used and the differences between them. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. [0:00:23]
 I also have a co-fire or coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that's [0:00:28]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:00:45]
 These are also available on part design, create shape binder and create a sub-objects shape [0:00:51]
 binder. Now these are normally used in the part design but they can be used elsewhere, [0:00:56]
 depending on which one we pick and basic demonstration of where you would use this is if you [0:01:02]
 create a body and that's creating a sketch in here, among the xy plane. [0:01:06]
 I'm going to create a simple rectangle with a rectangle tool and we're going to pad this [0:01:14]
 and we create a simple lid or box from this or a tray. I'm going to pad this with a 10mm pad [0:01:21]
 and then I'm going to apply a thickness within using the part design, apply a dress up feature [0:01:29]
 and using the thickness tool, also available from the toolbar within here. [0:01:34]
 Fickness of one millimeters fine so we've got a basic tray or a basic lid. [0:01:41]
 Now if I had say a poster place in here and this post we designed outside of this body. [0:01:52]
 So for instance that's designed it in something like the part workbench you can use the part [0:01:57]
 designed if you want or create a new body and we could design a post in there. [0:02:01]
 And we're placed a simple cylinder. You see that the cylinder sits outside the body. [0:02:07]
 So I'll see them do is here and let's say we transformed it into place. [0:02:14]
 It's a very simple cylinder. It's the kind of thing that we wouldn't do but if this was some [0:02:18]
 complex shape then it might be from a different body or a different workbench and the same applies. [0:02:26]
 So I need to reference this inside a sketch, say inside this body here. [0:02:32]
 Let's come back over to the part design and create a new sketch along the xyplane. [0:02:39]
 Now this sketch resides inside this body here so you can see the sketch is here. [0:02:46]
 The cylinder resides outside. So when we try to reference this we can't reference anything [0:02:54]
 outside of this body. Let's try referencing it using this stone geometry tool. [0:02:59]
 When I hover over this if we look down to the bottom left you can see the object belongs to [0:03:03]
 another body. Can't link. And this is to do with the scope of where this sits. So this sits [0:03:10]
 outside the body. We need to introduce something that will be placed within this body that has [0:03:16]
 reference to this cylinder. And this is where the shape binder comes in. [0:03:21]
 So to do that I'm going to click the face of the cylinder. We can see the cylinder's been [0:03:27]
 highlighted but we just got the face selected there. And I'm going to select the shape binder. [0:03:31]
 You notice that we have an active body. So when I click on that shape binder it will reference the [0:03:39]
 cylinder and face through that cylinder than one that we selected. The minute I hit OK, a shape binder [0:03:46]
 is placed within here. So a shape binder sits here. That's hide the cylinder and see what's happened. [0:03:53]
 We can see now we've got the face that's been lifted but a link is kept with the cylinder [0:04:01]
 and the shape binder's been placed inside the body. This allows me to over my sketch again and reference [0:04:09]
 the geometry. So that's left the geometry. It sits above the sketch. So you can see we got the sketch here. [0:04:17]
 If I use the section tool, sketch, view section, you notice it disappears. So when we reference the [0:04:25]
 geometry you'll be projected. Let's cut along this sketch plane. Let's get that back. [0:04:31]
 And that's reference that. So that's coming and just reference the edge. And what will happen is you'll see [0:04:39]
 that it will be projected. And we go onto that face there. I actually didn't [0:04:47]
 the reference the vertex first and there's a vertex just there and that pulled in first. Then I [0:04:54]
 reference that edge. So we can reference different parts of this geometry. Therefore we can now [0:05:00]
 sketch upon here. So for instance we'll create a circle, a scape and use this circle with a [0:05:09]
 circle and make those equal. Like so. So we've got something in there that we can use in a pad [0:05:18]
 and we've padded up. Timel. Anything we do with the original that's being referenced from [0:05:27]
 this cylinder here. That's changing the radius to say 5 mm. The shape binder is updated. [0:05:35]
 I just going to remove that pad and that shape binder. It's referenced in the sketch. So [0:05:43]
 might remove the sketch as well because very simple and the cylinder. And this time I'm going to [0:05:50]
 create some posts in here in this body. So we can understand how this is used in the real world. [0:06:01]
 And how we get into the differences between the shape binder and the sub-shaped binder. [0:06:06]
 Just going to reference in these edges. They're in the same body. So we can reference those in. [0:06:13]
 And I'm going to add some circles to each of the corners. Making sure they're tangent. I've [0:06:27]
 got the Altic and Strength checked so I can come in and select the edge and I'll get a [0:06:34]
 tangency between there. Still need to add a tangency between these two edges. But that's fine. [0:06:39]
 I'm just going to work my way around this quickly and that's both circles in. [0:06:42]
 The four circles are added. I'm going to use the tangency by selecting it from the top because [0:06:59]
 what I'm going to do is select the circle and an edge and therefore I don't have to come back [0:07:06]
 and click this again and constraint tangency because it's still active. So just going to work my way [0:07:13]
 around this box. So we have all the circles. I'm not going to use the equality. I might [0:07:28]
 move equal. And now going to set a radius. You can select it all from first and then select the [0:07:40]
 radius. That means the equality and the radius are applied at the same time. [0:07:45]
 So we have all the circles in here. Let's do a quick pad on that sketch. So we've got the posts [0:07:52]
 at the centerpoints. So now I'm going to create a new body and pull these into the new body. [0:08:02]
 So I can work on those posts separate from this main body. So this create a new body. What'll [0:08:08]
 happen is the current body will be made in active and the new body will be made active. [0:08:15]
 I want to reference these in another sketch but as we saw before we can't do that because it sits [0:08:22]
 outside of this body. So I know it's in another body it's still outside and this is the active body. [0:08:28]
 So what do I do? Well we use the shape binder and select the faces that we want to add. [0:08:36]
 Now I didn't select the faces before but we can click add geometry and select each of these. [0:08:44]
 We have to select add geometry as we go or we can just come out and select all the faces that we want. [0:08:52]
 Hold them down the control key and then using the shape binder to bind these and we get our faces at it. [0:09:01]
 You can see the object is pad one and I'll okay that. So now we've got the shape binder attached. [0:09:09]
 If I move the original body so remember we've got two bodies here. If I move this body right [0:09:18]
 click transform and move it over to the right and hit okay. Notice the shape binder stays [0:09:27]
 where it is. Even if I move the body that contains the shape binder and hit okay. [0:09:36]
 Then the shape binder doesn't follow. They still have a link back to the original. [0:09:42]
 So for instance it's coming to the pan and coming to the sketch and change the diameter. [0:09:50]
 Say 10 millimeters and hit close. You can see these have changed but we change this body by [0:10:02]
 transforming it. Then the shape binder doesn't follow. It only deals with the change [0:10:13]
 not the transforms of this body. Let's compare this behavior with a subject binder. [0:10:18]
 So I'm going to create a new body. This will come the active body and we're going to do the same. [0:10:26]
 That's hide and prove his body with the shape binder and now I'm going to select the same [0:10:31]
 faces using the control key. So that's in the mall and create the subject binder. [0:10:40]
 The binder has been created but this time when we move one of these bodies right click transform [0:10:46]
 then it will just snap back and load our body has moved. So right click transform [0:10:57]
 and okay you can see our body has moved but it's just snap back into position. The shape binder [0:11:09]
 has snap back. So great new sketch for reference x y plane okay and place say [0:11:18]
 and close that. So we've got some reference now so when I move this body [0:11:25]
 to the shape binder here's there okay that and the shape binder moves back. We can stop it [0:11:34]
 from doing that by clicking on the binder and changing the bind mode to detached. [0:11:40]
 Therefore when we change the body right click transform again and move this display [0:11:48]
 okay the shape binder stays where it is but there's one problem with this. [0:11:55]
 Is that we've just changed the synchronization of this to be detached. [0:12:00]
 Therefore when we edit the original parent [0:12:04]
 I'll just increase the font size in the sketch so we can see the dimensions and these icons [0:12:19]
 for the actual constraints. If I change this say 20 millimeters and hit close you can see we've changed [0:12:29]
 the inside but I shape binder has still stayed the same. So you might be thinking what's [0:12:38]
 the point in a sub shape binder. Let's take the font in the sample in a new project. [0:12:42]
 So in the part design create a body and create sketch along the x y plane and okay that. [0:12:51]
 I'm going to create a simple rectangle in here using the roundy rectangle but I'm going to remove [0:13:01]
 path this rectangle so I'm going to remove the top and delete that and hit close and now I'm [0:13:09]
 going to come around to the other side. The y-set plane that's bringing this around to the [0:13:17]
 correct position. I'm going to create an arc. Make sure nothing's selected new arc [0:13:25]
 along the y-set plane and I'll create an arc from this center point coming out like so. [0:13:40]
 Making sure it is connected to that center point at the moment I've got a point on mine constraint. [0:13:45]
 I'm going to take these two connect with a quits in a constraint. It's all to remove the [0:13:50]
 roundy constraint. So we've got this arc here that we've connected up. This end is not connected to [0:13:58]
 anything at the moment. Let's close that and what I'm going to do is take this sketch and change [0:14:05]
 the map mode. Click on the button on the end and we're saying plane at the top let's select that [0:14:12]
 so it's saying select in and click this point here. Our arc has been moved and okay that. [0:14:21]
 So we've got two sketches connected together. We can rotate the sketch using the attachment and the angle [0:14:29]
 and what the half one will rotate the arc will move with it. Let's rotate this say along a different [0:14:37]
 axis. This one here. Access at the moment is rotating along the z. So this way I rotate it along the [0:14:47]
 x. First of all in the x. Zero on the z. I can see we've got the arc in there. I'm just going to [0:14:56]
 come into the arc and do some adjustments. So I'm going to pull this geometry. I'm going to pull [0:15:01]
 in this line here. Hit escape and use this arc with this line and just place a tangency across [0:15:10]
 there. So we've got tangency going across here following that arc and hit close. [0:15:15]
 So we've got this shape. I can create another sketch for the profile. It's a great sketch. [0:15:26]
 Basically along the x. Y. Playing we're going to move in a moment and create just a small circle. [0:15:34]
 And this small circle we're going to sweep along here and that's close that and position that circle. [0:15:40]
 That's just renaying that to profile. So profile sketch and we take the profile sketch [0:15:49]
 looking at the map mode. At the moment is flat face upon this plane. Let's click that. [0:15:55]
 And that's flat. This point. Well that's first just like the [0:16:00]
 plane button. This top one. Same sledding. Click this point. It's moved. [0:16:07]
 Reference 2. I'm going to select this line and place it normal to edge. So we've got our sweep [0:16:17]
 where additive pipes sell. That's okay though. So we've got these three items in here. [0:16:25]
 Two sketches which are connected together and this profile. So make sure the profile is selected [0:16:33]
 and add an additive pipe. Part design. Add it to feature. Add it to pipe. [0:16:42]
 Now we can see the profile has been added. Now we can add the edge. What [0:16:50]
 what happens when we add the edge? So I've selected that button and clicked the edge of the sketch. [0:16:55]
 The object sketch has been filled here. But this part is a different sketch. [0:17:03]
 So as we move around adding the edges. When we get to the sketch that is not [0:17:12]
 the first one we selected and we're almost there as I had the last edge. It doesn't get added. [0:17:20]
 So we can only do this additive pipe along the first sketch. When we want to do something that's [0:17:28]
 curved this way across two planes then we've got a bit of an issue. And this is where the [0:17:33]
 substrate binder comes in. So we can't solve that and we've got two sketches. Let's take both of them. [0:17:40]
 The active body is the current body. So when we add the substrate binder it places it within this body. [0:17:49]
 I don't need those two sketches now because what's happened is that we've connected this all to one object. [0:17:57]
 So if you think about it before we have a problem with two objects then we've connected it to one object. [0:18:02]
 Therefore when we take the profile sketch and do an additive pipe. We can now add the edge [0:18:10]
 is of this object and it all will be added. All we can just click on the object and click on the [0:18:17]
 substrate binder to add all that in and hit OK. So now I've got the additive pipe [0:18:24]
 across two sketches that are being joined together. The shape binder only allows the different [0:18:34]
 geometry of a single object. The substrate binder allows you to reference geometry across objects. [0:18:41]
 Not only that it can be across files as well. So if we go back to our original file this one the [0:18:48]
 original project and we just save that as far one come back into here which is the other [0:19:03]
 project and click on the file tab and that's by and say the shape binder again taking this shape [0:19:12]
 come back to this project. I haven't clicked on anything but the minute I use the substrate binder [0:19:19]
 we can see the only document is not saved so it's trying to pull that in from the document. That's [0:19:24]
 save the owner document which is itself as file 2. Let's try that again. Let's go back to file one [0:19:35]
 and that's bring say the thickness back. So we've got this thickness here and we'll use this face [0:19:43]
 come to file 2 make sure you don't let anything you face is selected in the previous document [0:19:52]
 and substrate binder and we're pulling that face to bind in across files. We can't do that [0:19:59]
 with a shape binder because it asks us for the geometry. Those that in a different file the shape [0:20:11]
 binder is for the file that you're dealing with at the moment. It's a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of [0:20:16]
 that. So the substrate binder can bind across multiple files and across multiple objects. [0:20:24]
 Let's have a look at the options within both the shape binder and the substrate binder and compare them. [0:20:29]
 The shape binder is very simplistic. If I take the face and use the shape binder [0:20:37]
 to put it in a new body and hit OK. Let's have a look at the properties we can see it's very [0:20:45]
 simplistic. We've got trace of pull at the moment if I transform this body and hit OK. [0:20:56]
 Then you can see the shape binder is transformed but if I undo that click on the shape binder [0:21:06]
 and use the trace of pull. Hit true. Right click transform and move this hit OK. We'll bring the binder [0:21:18]
 back as we've shown before with the substrate binder. That's the only real option that we have [0:21:24]
 upon here with the substrate binder we have a lot more options. Let's get rid of this body [0:21:31]
 and select the face. Once again, I use a substrate binder. The substrate binder has been added [0:21:40]
 but there's a wealth of options here. One of my favorites is the offset because we have a plan of [0:21:47]
 face. The offset can be changed to increase the size of that binder. Let's reduce this down [0:21:58]
 and use say the fill offset to true. You can see we've created a fill between the offset [0:22:08]
 and the original size going outwards. These binders can be used in the parts or the part design [0:22:17]
 and can be used as any other object. I hope that's helpful if the shape binder is an [0:22:24]
 understanding of the difference between them. The shape binder is very simplistic but it has that [0:22:28]
 option of not tracing the support but allowing updates. Whereas the substrate binder has a [0:22:36]
 wealth of options it can be used across different objects across different files but it's not as [0:22:42]
 simplistic as a standard shape binder and we have to break the connection to allow for the body to [0:22:48]
 move without the shape binder moving. If we're referencing that shape binder is in a [0:22:53]
 novel object and it's moved then it can create a problem with our underlying geometry. If we [0:22:59]
 got a pad that's referenced to that shape binder and we've moved the original body then we have [0:23:05]
 an issue. It can break that body. We go through that in our next lesson where we're going to look [0:23:11]
 at creating a more complex assembly we're going to be using shape binders in there and creating a [0:23:18]
 simple latch using these techniques in this video. Hope you enjoyed that video and I hope to see you [0:23:23]
