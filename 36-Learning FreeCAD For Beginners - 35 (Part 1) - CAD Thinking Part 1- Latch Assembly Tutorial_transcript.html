===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD For Beginners - 35 (Part 1) - CAD Thinking Part 1- Latch Assembly Tutorial =====
 I have one and welcome back to the Learning Free Capital beginners teaching the fundamentals [0:00:04]
 of free CAD whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:07]
 Now we're going to be doing something a bit different today. [0:00:09]
 This video is actually spread over a number of videos. [0:00:13]
 There's about 5 in all and the idea is to compliment the Learning Free Capital for beginners [0:00:18]
 series with something that I call CAD thinking. [0:00:22]
 In the first kind of pilot to this we'll be creating this model so this is a latch assembly. [0:00:29]
 The problem a lot of people have and a lot of beginners have is breaking down the physical [0:00:35]
 form into a digital form. [0:00:37]
 So what I made into teaching in these videos is how to model each of these parts. [0:00:43]
 Breaking them down into their primitive form in a easy to learn way. [0:00:47]
 On that journey you're going to understand the reasons why we took such choices such [0:00:50]
 as tackling the object from one profile versus another. [0:00:54]
 We're going to be complimenting that by taking other choices as well so we're going to [0:00:58]
 be taking a different route through that journey and showing the consequences and challenges [0:01:03]
 off that route. [0:01:05]
 We're going to be covering such things as model stability, the reasons why we do filets [0:01:10]
 and shampers last. [0:01:11]
 Understanding in a different way is creating the part depending on the viewpoint we take. [0:01:16]
 We're following a part design and then an A2 plus assembly workbench workflow. [0:01:22]
 When you've finished you'll have what you see on screen here and the simulation behind [0:01:26]
 that. [0:01:27]
 But this is in multiple parts. [0:01:30]
 So once you completed one part the other part will be available on my channel. [0:01:34]
 If it's not then just wait a couple of days and it will appear. [0:01:38]
 I'm hoping to release this over a number of days. [0:01:41]
 Also once all the parts are on YouTube they will be also available for download from my [0:01:47]
 co-fi shop and you can consume this at your leisure. [0:01:51]
 So I hope you enjoy this series. [0:01:52]
 I hope you enjoy this pilot episode. [0:01:54]
 I am looking at doing episodes around organic modeling and curve modeling in the same vein. [0:02:02]
 So let's have a look how we would tackle such an object. [0:02:06]
 If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. [0:02:09]
 I also have a co-fi or a coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that's [0:02:14]

 Also run a Patreon where you can subscribe and get extra content. [0:02:23]
 That's that www.patreon.com, 4-mango-jelly solutions. [0:02:28]
 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:02:31]
 So this is the assembly that will be creating free CAD. [0:02:35]
 When I started this I actually had the physical latch itself in my hand and I was looking [0:02:39]
 it from all the different angles. [0:02:42]
 The first thing I did with this latch was break it up into the individual parts. [0:02:46]
 Now when we transfer a physical object to CAD it can be quite hard to get and mind around [0:02:52]
 the different shapes and forms and how to translate those into a digital form. [0:02:57]
 Now one thing to remember with this it's human made. [0:03:00]
 Therefore it's probably made in a package such as CAD. [0:03:04]
 So a primitive object is in shape that make up the latch. [0:03:07]
 We'll more likely be available in the CAD package as because it's been created from [0:03:12]
 that CAD package in the first place. [0:03:14]
 So if we think about in free CAD we have cylinder, we have the sphere, the cube, etc. [0:03:22]
 We have to think wider as well regarding the 2D objects we have in there. [0:03:27]
 So look at the sketch on think about what we've got in there. [0:03:29]
 We've got circle, we've got arc, we've got slot. [0:03:32]
 So when tackling something like this we first need to make the object less complex in our mind. [0:03:40]
 Visualize in it in that way. [0:03:42]
 So with this we need to take away the parts until we get to the part that we want to model, [0:03:49]
 which is this part here. [0:03:50]
 So we can start with this part here. [0:03:53]
 When those parts have been taken away we can focus on this shape. [0:03:59]
 Though this is being recroating free CAD if I had this in my hand I'll be doing that [0:04:03]
 the same thing. [0:04:04]
 Straight away I can see that this is slot geometry. [0:04:10]
 So I'm looking at from different profiles and looking at from the top. [0:04:14]
 I'm looking at from the side. [0:04:16]
 I'll be doing this with the physical object itself in my hand and also looking at from [0:04:20]
 the back. [0:04:21]
 I'm picking out the profiles from those viewpoints. [0:04:25]
 So if I look at from the top I can see we've got circles and the slot. [0:04:30]
 So in sketch we have those tools. [0:04:33]
 From the side I can see we've got this hook shape, which is basically two arcs. [0:04:38]
 So we've got two profiles we've got a slot profile. [0:04:42]
 And then from the side we've got this hook profile. [0:04:46]
 I'll be supplying the initial pictures of this part on my blog, including technical drawings [0:04:52]
 for the actual item itself. [0:04:54]
 So let's start to model the latch assembly part one. [0:04:57]
 So we're going to first tackle this from the top profile and profile is a very simple. [0:05:02]
 And we're going to use this top profile and first create our slot. [0:05:08]
 If we look we can see that this actually flares out here. [0:05:11]
 So it's actually going out this way as well. [0:05:14]
 So we're going to tackle it from the top and then work on the side. [0:05:17]
 The green is what we're going to add and the red is what we're going to remove. [0:05:21]
 Along with the sketch geometry that we're going to use. [0:05:23]
 Look at the technical drawing for the reference. [0:05:26]
 We can see we've got the slot with the two holes and we've got the radius of the holes [0:05:30]
 and the slot. [0:05:31]
 So let's sketch those. [0:05:33]
 We're in the part design. [0:05:34]
 We're creating new document and creating new body. [0:05:38]
 We're going to use sketch and we're looking down on the XY plane and hit OK. [0:05:42]
 Looking down from the top. [0:05:45]
 We're going to start with a simple slot. [0:05:51]
 Now we have our slot that's put some dimensions in. [0:05:54]
 So we're going to take the top arc and make the diameter, strain diameter, and make that [0:06:02]
 14 millimeters and hit OK. [0:06:05]
 So now we've got one dimension in. [0:06:07]
 We can start adding some more constraints. [0:06:10]
 Let's take these two points and this one. [0:06:15]
 We're going to make sure that the removed redundant constraints are on. [0:06:19]
 This checkbox here. [0:06:21]
 So click it. [0:06:22]
 Make sure it's in order to remove redundant constraints and the autoconstraints are on [0:06:26]
 as well. [0:06:27]
 We're going to make those symmetrical. [0:06:29]
 So that's symmetrical to the center. [0:06:33]
 If we have some skewering like this, then we can take one of the sides and place a [0:06:39]
 vertical constraint upon that. [0:06:41]
 So we have this shape now. [0:06:45]
 That's constrained the height. [0:06:47]
 To do that, we need to actually constrain these two points here and take into account the [0:06:53]
 radius. [0:06:54]
 So we're going to take these two points and place a height in here. [0:07:01]
 So if you think what we got, we've got the 14 millimeter diameter. [0:07:05]
 So we've got taking in both the radius to the bottom of the top, which is half of this [0:07:09]
 times two. [0:07:10]
 So it's still 14. [0:07:11]
 And we've got to figure out the length here. [0:07:13]
 This isn't the length of this side. [0:07:14]
 This is the length of the curve. [0:07:17]
 This bit here. [0:07:19]
 So our full length is 24. [0:07:21]
 So we can use 10 in here, 10 millimeters. [0:07:24]
 So the 24 minus 14. [0:07:29]
 We have a fully constrained shape, but we do need to modify this slot geometry. [0:07:34]
 If we look back, we can see that this part here straight and this part is our angle and [0:07:41]
 this way. [0:07:42]
 Geometry has been broken here and an arc has been placed in. [0:07:45]
 Let's do that. [0:07:46]
 So delete left hand geometry. [0:07:51]
 Use an arc. [0:07:52]
 I'm going to go for an endpoint from room point because I can select the top point and [0:07:57]
 the distance to the bottom point because we've got the autoconstraints on. [0:08:01]
 So when I arrive, we get a quinton and we place that arc in. [0:08:06]
 We next take this arc and this arc and use a tangent constraint. [0:08:13]
 So okay that's. [0:08:14]
 We've got some problems along the right hand side. [0:08:16]
 So I'm going to select that right hand side and use a vertical constraint toÂ∑ù [0:08:20]
 that back in. [0:08:22]
 We're going to do the same with the top arc. [0:08:25]
 Now we've got control of this tangent arc. [0:08:31]
 So you can see these are becoming around this way. [0:08:34]
 After the time being, I'm just going to take this point and this line. [0:08:38]
 Point on object constraint. [0:08:40]
 So it's fully constrained. [0:08:43]
 Now we're going to add some circles. [0:08:45]
 So I'm going to create a circle constraint at this point, quinton and this one. [0:08:55]
 Let's set the radius of these circles. [0:08:56]
 We're looking for the inner radius. [0:08:57]
 This one here, which is R2. [0:09:00]
 So two millimeters. [0:09:02]
 The 2.5 is the shantar, which will add last. [0:09:06]
 So we're going to hit escape to get a mass point of back. [0:09:08]
 Take both of these at the same time and add the radius. [0:09:13]
 Make sure it's radius not diameter of two millimeters. [0:09:19]
 And hit close. [0:09:21]
 Now we've got our first shape. [0:09:24]
 We've made some assumptions with this arc and we can select that sketch and make our [0:09:29]
 pad. [0:09:30]
 Looking back, we can see we've got a height here of 2mm. [0:09:34]
 So this is going to be our pad. [0:09:37]
 2mm. [0:09:38]
 And okay. [0:09:40]
 So we've got this shape here. [0:09:42]
 We can change this radius if we want if it's too large. [0:09:48]
 Which we can see it is so I can come into the pad. [0:09:51]
 Double-click on the sketch. [0:09:54]
 And we've attached it to this body here. [0:09:56]
 So this is a point on object constraints. [0:09:57]
 I can delete that and bring this in. [0:10:01]
 And we're set the radius of this. [0:10:05]
 Here's the radius constraint. [0:10:06]
 I'm going to say 25 for the time being. [0:10:10]
 We don't know this. [0:10:12]
 We're just going to add one in for the time being. [0:10:16]
 Let's close that. [0:10:17]
 We've got our first pad. [0:10:21]
 And now we can use the side profile. [0:10:24]
 So coming from the side profile, this one here. [0:10:29]
 And add this curve. [0:10:31]
 Now this is where the symmetry came in. [0:10:35]
 When I added the sketch we created symmetry across the center point. [0:10:40]
 So I've got to view. [0:10:42]
 Togle axis cross, we can see the center point here. [0:10:45]
 This can make your life a lot easier. [0:10:47]
 I'm going to create a sketch along the front. [0:10:52]
 So make sure nothing's selected. [0:10:55]
 New sketch, exit plane. [0:10:57]
 And we're going to create a sketch here. [0:11:01]
 Come up to the sketch. [0:11:03]
 View section. [0:11:04]
 And you can see we've gone straight through the center of that object. [0:11:10]
 If we look at the technical drawing we can see we just got two arcs on two lines. [0:11:15]
 Let's place the lines in first. [0:11:19]
 So we got the impulse geometry. [0:11:24]
 And we can come around and use this vertex here. [0:11:27]
 Come on get the vertex then we just bring in this arc. [0:11:31]
 So we've got that point there. [0:11:34]
 We don't need the bottom point because we can place it in line or actually attach it to [0:11:38]
 this horizontal. [0:11:42]
 So I'm going to sketch a line coming out and do the same for down here. [0:11:50]
 Place it in a point on object constraint along here. [0:11:54]
 And we're doing the same for a line that goes down here. [0:11:56]
 I can see that I've missed this point here. [0:12:01]
 So I'm going to make sure this one has a vertical constraint and take this point. [0:12:07]
 And this point make those points. [0:12:10]
 One line is for the constraint. [0:12:14]
 We'll add a vertical constraint along there as well. [0:12:19]
 Come front and now we can start adding the arcs. [0:12:22]
 Look at the arcs we can see that these lines where the arcs start. [0:12:27]
 Basically attach these lines and these points are in line. [0:12:30]
 Follow this up we can see that the arc comes around and it's basically in line with [0:12:34]
 those points as well. [0:12:36]
 We've got no length here. [0:12:38]
 So that can be derived by another measurement elsewhere in this diagram. [0:12:43]
 So let's take these two points and place them in line, vertical constraint. [0:12:49]
 And using the end point and room points arc we're going to come up and create two arcs. [0:12:58]
 Now you can see the line that goes through the middle of that arc. [0:13:03]
 That determines where that arc's going to sit. [0:13:05]
 So just to bring it in line with those two. [0:13:08]
 Like so. [0:13:11]
 And we do the same with this one as well. [0:13:14]
 Just bring this in line. [0:13:17]
 Here's scape and we set the radius. [0:13:19]
 The radius is 4 and 2. [0:13:22]
 So radius for this one. [0:13:27]
 4 and the radius for this one. [0:13:33]
 So radius 2. [0:13:37]
 We can see that these points are basically almost connected. [0:13:40]
 They're on top of each other. [0:13:41]
 So we can highlight both of those using the box selection. [0:13:45]
 So click and drag and click on the quince and constraint. [0:13:50]
 That means those are on top of each other. [0:13:52]
 We're going to place a line in to connect these two up. [0:13:58]
 That's added a constraint on there, a vertical constraint. [0:14:03]
 And I'm just going to make sure that this point and this point are in line. [0:14:08]
 So everything now is in line. [0:14:11]
 We just need to figure out this length here. [0:14:14]
 Going back to the technical drawing. [0:14:15]
 We can see that we've got a length 20 millimeters to the edge of this arc. [0:14:23]
 It's a 20 millimeters up to here. [0:14:25]
 Going back, well we haven't got anything too add that 20 millimeters on to. [0:14:30]
 So we need some kind of vertex here. [0:14:33]
 This is where the point comes in. [0:14:35]
 Select point. [0:14:36]
 Roll over that arc because we've got the order constraint so you can see a point on object [0:14:40]
 constraint. [0:14:41]
 Click. [0:14:42]
 And then create a constraint between that point and this point, the center point of those [0:14:47]
 arcs, and make that horizontally aligned. [0:14:53]
 So this doesn't move up and down now. [0:14:56]
 Therefore I can come over and bring in a point along this side. [0:15:00]
 It doesn't matter which point you bring in, we can use the bottom or the top. [0:15:04]
 So I'll bring in that point of this line. [0:15:07]
 And now I'm going to take the point on the arc and the point on this line and set a horizontal [0:15:14]
 distance of 20 millimeters. [0:15:18]
 We are fully constrained and set close. [0:15:24]
 Note where the sketch lies. [0:15:27]
 So it lies in the middle of this object. [0:15:30]
 So I'm going to click the sketch and add a pad. [0:15:35]
 The tip at the moment is this pad. [0:15:39]
 So we're adding to the history. [0:15:41]
 So let the sketch click the pad. [0:15:43]
 The pad is failing. [0:15:45]
 So there's something wrong with our geometry. [0:15:48]
 If I hit OK, you can see pad results has multiple solids. [0:15:53]
 This is not spoil this time. [0:15:56]
 So something's wrong. [0:15:58]
 Hit symmetrical to plane and hit OK, we still got the problem. [0:16:04]
 That's cancel out of there and see what's going wrong. [0:16:08]
 Let's double click the sketch and look closer. [0:16:15]
 So if you think about what's happening, let's go into sketch. [0:16:19]
 Review section. [0:16:20]
 Take that off. [0:16:23]
 When we pad because we have this arc here, it's actually coming off this line and [0:16:30]
 creating two separate bodies. [0:16:32]
 So if we go forward, you can see that because we got this arc that goes around here, [0:16:37]
 it actually comes off of this line. [0:16:41]
 How do we solve that? [0:16:44]
 So we need to just place more material inside this object. [0:16:50]
 So I'm going to release this point from this line by hitting delete. [0:16:55]
 So that's come out to the sketch back to view section and see what's happened. [0:17:00]
 I'm going to take this point and push it inwards. [0:17:06]
 I also take the bottom point. [0:17:09]
 These points have become unconnected. [0:17:11]
 So I'm going to take this point. [0:17:13]
 This point and make those quincident. [0:17:17]
 So now I've pushed this in. [0:17:19]
 I can push it further into the material to compensate for this arc. [0:17:25]
 If we look, we bought in the vertex here by just clicking on this line. [0:17:31]
 So it's bought in the vertex from the start and the vertex from the middle point here, [0:17:37]
 the end of that edge. [0:17:40]
 The best idea is to take this point and this point. [0:17:44]
 Make that quincident. [0:17:48]
 We still have movement here. [0:17:50]
 So you can see we got this movement here. [0:17:52]
 So I'm going to take this point because it moves past. [0:17:56]
 So we'll keep them in line. [0:17:58]
 So take this point and the center point. [0:18:02]
 Vertical and constraint. [0:18:03]
 We're all constrained down. [0:18:04]
 That's close. [0:18:06]
 And now when we've pad. [0:18:08]
 We can see our pad has taken effect. [0:18:11]
 We need to make this symmetrical. [0:18:13]
 By clicking on symmetrical to plane. [0:18:17]
 That places that in the center there. [0:18:21]
 We've got enough material in here. [0:18:22]
 It looks a bit ugly. [0:18:23]
 But when we hit OK, we can actually refine that in our last process. [0:18:30]
 So the measurement for the pad is actually incorrect. [0:18:32]
 We're going to change that later. [0:18:34]
 And in doing so, I'm going to show you how that affects any fillet that's been applied [0:18:38]
 after that. [0:18:40]
 So what we're doing now, we're coming to our last process in building this object. [0:18:45]
 And that is refinement and chamfer's and fillets. [0:18:47]
 Let's deal with the chamfer's and fillets first. [0:18:50]
 So we always had this last of all reason been. [0:18:53]
 If you add it earlier on in the process, then we're creating more faces and more edges, [0:18:59]
 which can break our geometry. [0:19:01]
 So we actually referenced in edges. [0:19:04]
 We don't want to reference in fillets or chamfer's because we can add a chamfering here. [0:19:10]
 And often we adjust those. [0:19:12]
 So we can make the 1 millimeter, 2 millimeter. [0:19:15]
 Depending on how we want the object to look, if we keep on changing those, we can [0:19:20]
 affect an edge that's reference to. [0:19:24]
 Because we may end up creating a chamfer that creates another edge or another face. [0:19:29]
 And that can be damaging to the geometry that's referenced upon that. [0:19:33]
 For instance, I can create a chamfer here on this one using the part design, apply dress up and chamfer. [0:19:42]
 We can see that the radius here is 2.5, so we've added a 0.5 onto this radius. [0:19:48]
 Size of 0.5. [0:19:51]
 Here enter, so we've got our first chamfer in here. [0:19:56]
 If we added a sketch upon this face and reference this circle here, then you can see straight [0:20:02]
 away I've forgotten to add this one in. [0:20:05]
 If I came back to this, we're adding more faces to that operation. [0:20:09]
 That can affect the geometry above that's been referenced to it. [0:20:13]
 So this way, the last action to note by the tip is the chamfer. [0:20:19]
 And it's safe for me to come in here and add another edge to say here. [0:20:28]
 And here, OK. [0:20:32]
 Now I've got nothing to above it, that's referencing it. [0:20:35]
 That can cause a problem. [0:20:38]
 I'm now going to put a fillet around here, so I'm going to take these two edges to the top [0:20:45]
 of the bottom, control step both at this. [0:20:49]
 Part design, apply dress up and fill it or use the icon over here. [0:20:58]
 Then recompute fail because it's 1mm, this is a 2mm fillet, so it's going 1mm. [0:21:03]
 One way, 1mm the other, and it's equal in 2mm, so it doesn't actually work. [0:21:09]
 We have to go for an all point 9. [0:21:12]
 There, and we get our fillet. [0:21:15]
 So we look, we get a 1mm fillet that goes out here, 1mm fillet goes out here and they end [0:21:23]
 up sharing the same edge you can't do. [0:21:26]
 You just make it a little bit shorter, 0.99, or even 0.99, and here, OK. [0:21:35]
 Therefore, we've got our curve there. [0:21:39]
 We have enough fillet going around the outside here. [0:21:43]
 So for that, I can select the edges that run around the outside. [0:21:54]
 We have 2mm to play with, and add the fillet. [0:22:04]
 So you can see that's how did there. [0:22:07]
 We get to go for a 1mm fillet. [0:22:08]
 Most of the time, we find upon our typical drawing, we can see that this line is the [0:22:13]
 roundabout, the middle point. [0:22:15]
 So we've got a 1mm fillet coming down and 2mm height. [0:22:18]
 So we're taking half that height. [0:22:21]
 So what we're doing is just filling in calculated assumptions with the ones that we don't [0:22:25]
 have. [0:22:26]
 And here, OK. [0:22:29]
 Basically, finish down model. [0:22:30]
 Now we've got these faces in here, which when this is exported out for 3D printing [0:22:37]
 or machining, then these won't matter. [0:22:40]
 But we can tie it to the assarp. [0:22:42]
 We've got the fillet. [0:22:45]
 If we look down, we've got the part design. [0:22:47]
 And we've got something called Revine. [0:22:49]
 So this is the last action. [0:22:50]
 So we can set that refine to true. [0:22:55]
 What that do is look for planar faces. [0:22:59]
 Faces all along the same plane and it will remove them. [0:23:02]
 Well, it won't remove them. [0:23:03]
 It will remove them together. [0:23:05]
 So we can see that this is all along the same plane. [0:23:08]
 And it's merged by faces together. [0:23:10]
 So this is the last refinement. [0:23:14]
 What we have now is our tree in the part design. [0:23:19]
 And this is basically going back in time. [0:23:21]
 So we've got the fillet. [0:23:22]
 If I click on the next one, press the space bar. [0:23:24]
 The fillet disappears and we get the fillet before. [0:23:27]
 And we can move back through time. [0:23:29]
 So when we get to this pad, if I come into here, we can see we have this sketch. [0:23:35]
 If I press the space bar, we have the sketch for this pad. [0:23:40]
 And from what we've said previously, the length of this isn't correct. [0:23:45]
 It's actually 12 millimeters. [0:23:47]
 So we're going to the pad, click on the pad. [0:23:51]
 And we're going to change the length. [0:23:53]
 So gone back in time. [0:23:54]
 And now I'm affecting the length of this pad. [0:23:57]
 We have to be careful with all the features that I'm front of this. [0:24:02]
 If we change something on our pad, for instance, [0:24:05]
 we're going to change this length. [0:24:06]
 So it pushes this way. [0:24:09]
 Then it may have a fit on our shampers. [0:24:12]
 Because it may remove some of the faces along here, [0:24:16]
 because they're not needed anymore. [0:24:18]
 And they're taken up by that pad. [0:24:20]
 This is not a topological name initiative. [0:24:23]
 This happens with all CAD packages. [0:24:26]
 If you update a feature that removes a face or an edge, [0:24:30]
 that other geometry is referencing, then your CAD package will error [0:24:35]
 until you want the problem is. [0:24:37]
 This will happen in Fusion 360. [0:24:39]
 It will happen in FreeCAD. [0:24:41]
 It is not the topological name initiative. [0:24:43]
 That is something totally different. [0:24:46]
 So let's take this pad and just increase the length first [0:24:50]
 by 11 millimeters. [0:24:53]
 You can see that we've got ticks coming up against the shamper [0:24:58]
 and against the pad. [0:25:00]
 That means if I click off, that they will recompute. [0:25:05]
 Let's go for 12 millimeters, the correct length. [0:25:10]
 We can see we've got a problem. [0:25:11]
 We've got an exclamation mark over the body. [0:25:14]
 So something gets happened, which is caused an error. [0:25:17]
 And if we roll off the body, we can see it's saying tip shape, [0:25:20]
 is empty. [0:25:22]
 If I bring the length back of that pad to 11, [0:25:28]
 we can see we've got no problems. [0:25:30]
 So something's happening with this tip. [0:25:33]
 Let's take a closer look. [0:25:36]
 So we're zoom in to see what's happening. [0:25:38]
 Obviously this is growing in size. [0:25:45]
 So take the pad. [0:25:47]
 Let's try 11.5. [0:25:54]
 We still got a problem. [0:25:55]
 11.4. [0:26:00]
 11.3. [0:26:03]
 11.2. [0:26:06]
 And you can see the problem goes away. [0:26:08]
 So in between 11.2 and 11.3, an issue occurs. [0:26:15]
 So this is 12. [0:26:20]
 And delete the tip, the one that is complaining about. [0:26:23]
 So this little icon here, the green is the tip. [0:26:27]
 You can see it when I press a space bar, it has vanished. [0:26:30]
 That's delete that. [0:26:32]
 And we can see that problem has gone away. [0:26:34]
 That's try adding the fillet to these edges. [0:26:38]
 So this is what was applied before. [0:26:40]
 We're going to take all the edges, control select them, [0:26:45]
 and add the fillet. [0:26:52]
 We can see we've got a problem. [0:26:54]
 Let's try fillet of 0.5. [0:26:59]
 So previous fillet was too large for this feature. [0:27:02]
 And we can see what's happening. [0:27:04]
 And that the fillet is coming around here. [0:27:06]
 And it's growing. [0:27:10]
 So the 0.6 is good to 0.9. [0:27:19]
 And you can see how it's vanishing. [0:27:21]
 0.7. [0:27:23]
 And it's appeared back. [0:27:24]
 Sometimes we fillet, we have problems when it comes to these types [0:27:32]
 of areas. [0:27:34]
 So you can see where this is coming around here. [0:27:36]
 We've obviously got a problem in here. [0:27:38]
 We've got a number of edges in here that are probably affecting [0:27:41]
 this fillet. [0:27:42]
 So remember when we refined the face before, well, [0:27:48]
 that's refined this and add the fillet. [0:27:50]
 So I'm going to delete that fillet, [0:27:53]
 select the last fillet, which took absolutely fine. [0:27:59]
 Select refined to true. [0:28:02]
 That refined this object. [0:28:04]
 Now select the edges. [0:28:06]
 By selecting one edge, and then using the control key, [0:28:09]
 as we move around the other edges, [0:28:11]
 keeping that held down to apply it to the selection. [0:28:14]
 And apply the fillet. [0:28:19]
 And the one millimeter fillet has taken. [0:28:22]
 So that refinement has cleaned up the edges [0:28:28]
 and allowed that fillet to take. [0:28:31]
 So we'll always work trying to refine the object [0:28:33]
 when you have problems with fillets. [0:28:36]
 When you have the types of junctions without the refined, [0:28:39]
 between these edges. [0:28:47]
 And you can see we've gone into error, [0:28:49]
 the minute we come into the refined. [0:28:52]
 And it's sold out problem. [0:28:56]
 Bring them for the back. [0:29:01]
 And just hide the sketch press and the spacebar. [0:29:05]
