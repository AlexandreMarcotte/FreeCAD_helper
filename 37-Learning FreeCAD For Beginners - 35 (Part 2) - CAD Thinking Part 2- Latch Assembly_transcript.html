===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD For Beginners - 35 (Part 2) - CAD Thinking Part 2- Latch Assembly =====
 So we're in the second part of the latch assembly, and we're going to create this object here. [0:00:04]
 Now, again, we're going to be looking at from the different sides, the different profiles. [0:00:09]
 So we've got the side profile here, the top, and the front view. [0:00:14]
 Now, it's important in this case that we pick the right profile to start with. [0:00:19]
 The profile that you choose to start with will help reduce the number of steps to completion [0:00:25]
 and also increase the model stability. [0:00:28]
 Now, when we talk about model stability, we're talking about how many layers of operations we apply [0:00:34]
 to a model, the smaller number of operations, the more stable the model. [0:00:39]
 So if we look at starting from the profile from, say, the front as we're doing here, [0:00:45]
 we will create this shape here. So we're using symmetry to our vantage, [0:00:50]
 but tackling it from this point of view, we end up removing material from these points [0:00:56]
 as shown in this diagram and adding the fillet around here. [0:01:00]
 If we look at that workflow in the part design using that profile, using symmetry to our vantage, [0:01:06]
 we first start with a sketch, then we create our first operation the pad. [0:01:13]
 We then create another sketch to remove this material, then create a pocket. [0:01:19]
 Another sketch is created to remove the holes in this curve and then create another pocket. [0:01:26]
 We then get into our finishing process with the fillets. So we need to fill it around here [0:01:33]
 to allow this to pivot and not catch on any other material. So this will be the upper part of this latch. [0:01:40]
 We then create another fillet to clean up this edge and finally we add the mirror. [0:01:46]
 So we're all in all we have a number of operations in here. We can vastly reduce these by choosing [0:01:53]
 a different profile. So we need to be observant of what we're doing. Look for symmetry, but it's not [0:01:59]
 always beneficial to use it. We'll see that in our next workflow. Look for subtraction of material [0:02:06]
 as well as addition. That's look at a simpler approach. With this profile, we can see we can just sketch [0:02:14]
 this shape. If we pad that, then we just need to remove this space. So this is negative space. [0:02:23]
 So we'll look at one single sketch here for the buyer pad and then creating this sketch within here [0:02:32]
 removing that material. We've just done the bulk of our modeling into operations. Because we've [0:02:38]
 got less operations in there, we have a more stable model. If we wanted to add another feature, [0:02:44]
 earlier on in our tree, then we got less operations to go through. For instance, with this model, [0:02:50]
 you can see we have a number of operations. If I added an operation say back here with this sketch, [0:02:58]
 then we would have to be wary of the operations that follow it along this tree. So I added [0:03:05]
 something to here could affect all the operations in front of that or one of these operations. [0:03:11]
 If we had a smaller tree, then the model becomes more stable. This is the same in every CAD package, [0:03:21]
 not only free CAD. Let's take a look at model in this part using the side profile and removing [0:03:27]
 this negative space. If you like, we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a co-fire [0:03:33]

 And that's at www.patreon.com for slash mango jelly solutions. Any money that's kindly donated will [0:03:53]
 be used to span the channel. So I've already created a new document and I'm in the part design [0:03:58]
 in free CAD. You notice we've got part one open already as well. I'm going to use this as a reference [0:04:03]
 just to get an idea of where about in free d space. I am going to place this part. Remember [0:04:09]
 in back to what we said before, we're going to take this profile. I remove the negative space [0:04:14]
 to create this profile. After we've padded the profile I've started with. So what I'm looking at [0:04:21]
 is that when I build this, I really want to get understanding of where the latch is going to be placed [0:04:26]
 and those going to be pulled into an assembly. It's useful to have your previous parts so we can [0:04:32]
 line up the body to this and see where it sits. That's go back to that document and reference that [0:04:38]
 into our project. For that I'm going to be using the make link sits up here on the toolbar. [0:04:44]
 I've got the project open part one and I'm going to click on the fillet and I'm going to use the tab [0:04:53]
 to come back to my project. I haven't used the combo view to click on it. I'll just use the tab [0:05:00]
 and I'm going to create a link. It's going to ask me first to save the document so we need to save [0:05:06]
 this document first. So I'll do that and save this as part 2. Now I want to come back in, [0:05:18]
 click on that fillet. Click on the part 2 tab. I can now use my link and I'll link it in the fillet. [0:05:26]
 There is enough way of doing this. Let's just delete that for that second and come back to part 1. [0:05:32]
 Click on the fillet and hold down the alt key on the keyboard and left it and you can see we [0:05:40]
 got a link there and drop it into part 2. It's a link to cross one file and place it into part 2. [0:05:49]
 So now we have this linked part. This means we can select the top and decide where this is going to [0:05:59]
 sit. So I'm going to right-click and transform this and rotate this around this way. [0:06:08]
 And here okay. I don't create a new body. So come out to create a new body. There's our body. [0:06:16]
 We're going to model from this profile. So new sketch and now we can see where that's going to go. [0:06:23]
 So I'm going to go along the x-z plane. This one here. [0:06:27]
 It's placed me in the center of the screen. This was create around the center. [0:06:31]
 But I actually want this off to left. So this part I want off to the left. [0:06:36]
 So just come into the model. Click on the fillet right-click. Transform and we'll move this over [0:06:44]
 and okay that. [0:06:45]
 We need to come back into the sketch and we can go an idea of where that's going to sit. [0:06:51]
 So I'm going to create the part around this point here. I may want to transform this a bit more [0:06:58]
 and rather guessing that's okay that. And come up to the view. [0:07:08]
 Took a laxist cross. So we can see the axis cross there. It makes life a lot easier when we transform in the part. [0:07:14]
 Right click transform. And we'll place it about there. It's just a give us an idea of where [0:07:23]
 this is going to sit and what's going to look like. [0:07:26]
 Let's go click on that sketch. [0:07:30]
 So we can start to add our first geometry. I'm going to come out to the art tool [0:07:36]
 and start adding geometry in an additive way. Now when I say additive way I'm adding the [0:07:43]
 individual elements of the geometry. So the first part is an actual arc that comes around here. [0:07:50]
 So hit this, skate to get a mouse point of back and from the diagram we know that this has a radius [0:07:56]
 of 3mm. So we've added an arc and we look back in the next geometry is 17mm line [0:08:06]
 followed by an arc and then followed by a vertical line. So this is additive geometry. We're adding [0:08:13]
 the geometry in an additive way. There is enough of adding geometry and that's in a subtractive [0:08:20]
 way and we can combine these two together and I'll just get in these elements. So a line and I'm [0:08:27]
 going to use the endpoint to run point arc. I flip between the two because here I'm just creating an arc [0:08:35]
 with just one connection points because I've got the alter constraints on. So when I hover over a [0:08:42]
 point you can see we've got a quenston constraint there. So when I get to something like this I would use [0:08:48]
 a simple endpoint and a Rimpoint arc with this one because I was constraining to the vertical axis [0:08:58]
 and the point of origin. I know I can constrain directly to these so I use the other arc [0:09:05]
 the center and the endpoint arc so I have those constraints straight away in there. So if I [0:09:12]
 did these in an additive way I'm actually adding them to the screen the different drawing trees [0:09:18]
 and constraining as I go. So 17mm we know this arc is a radius of 60mm. So click on the arc [0:09:28]
 and find the radius of 60mm and we carry on. Now I just place that point on this line [0:09:40]
 point on object constraint. So we're adding them in an additive way. We could do this in [0:09:48]
 a subtractive way and that would require to understand the geometry that we're laying down [0:09:53]
 for that we need to pick out the permutives. So we can see that if we look at this it's basically [0:10:00]
 a slot and then we've got a circle or an arc that we can add in there. [0:10:05]
 And we subtract one from the other. Use an trim tool. This can be a string in the fast way [0:10:12]
 placing down that drama tree. For this one I'm just going to use the additive. So it needs lines [0:10:19]
 so I'm going to place the line in here. I'm going to go start at the up. It's gap and set [0:10:25]
 some height so that's pick this line set the height. That's two millimeters and we need a line [0:10:35]
 going this way as well so we'll just click on the line and set a line that goes along here. [0:10:40]
 And this one was 23 millimeters. [0:10:43]
 We're just netting up the constraints. Need another two millimeter line. It goes down. [0:11:03]
 Click on that. That's two two mil. So these two points will stay in line because of the height [0:11:13]
 and we need to place a line in here as well. So using the line tool we've got the [0:11:20]
 old constraints on so I'm rolling over and we get a quince of constraint and a quince of constraint [0:11:26]
 there and horizontal constraints so then all nice in line. Set a scape. Pull these constraints [0:11:32]
 out of the way. We have movement still and if we look down to this one we can see the full length [0:11:40]
 of this from the back to the front is 30 millimeters so we need to add that to our profile. [0:11:48]
 So we can do that by coming in and adding a constraint to this so that's hide the fillet [0:11:57]
 minute and we'll add a point on object constraint to this arc. [0:12:04]
 Constraining this point to this line we have point on object constraint. [0:12:11]
 Therefore we can take this point and this point and set some distance. [0:12:18]
 Using the distance of 30 millimeters so that should have constrained that top line but it [0:12:31]
 doesn't seem to have happened. Let's have a look. I'm just moving the lines. I look [0:12:37]
 like it's a bit of a refresh problem and it's still showing that we're not constrained so we've [0:12:45]
 got a problem somewhere. That's just move these out of the way and see if we can find the problem. [0:12:50]
 We've got this line going this way and I start to move some of this so I can't there we go we can [0:13:00]
 move this down and looks like this point is not connected to the vertical and we use a point [0:13:09]
 on object constraint there. So we're now fully constrained and we can create our pad. [0:13:15]
 I hope to toss here close we've got our profile. If we look at the technical drawing we can [0:13:23]
 pad this so we're looking to pad this way by 21 millimeters or we could go further with the drawing [0:13:32]
 and add the holes of 3mm into and then another one of 3mm. So that's you at this point what you want [0:13:40]
 to do you can add those in or you could add them in afterwards and then do the pocket. I'm going to [0:13:45]
 add those in into that sketch. Let's come back into the sketch and add the first one in here and [0:13:53]
 I'm just going to add them like so and set these two in using together. So that in one then the [0:14:04]
 other we don't have to hold down the control because it's a hungry selection and we're set the [0:14:10]
 diameter of 3mm. This one is a 2mm diameter so we added those in there. Now where are these [0:14:23]
 placed because if we look back at a technical drawing we can see we haven't got any measurement. [0:14:28]
 Don't be afraid at this point to take a ruler and start measuring across the screen. [0:14:34]
 For instance I know from here to here 7mm because we can see it down here and we can start to [0:14:42]
 measure that to see if we have any relation between these measurements and if I'm just going to [0:14:47]
 measure it on the screen then we can get an idea of where that sits. I'm going to use the [0:14:53]
 7mm between these. So from this point and this point, using the length of 7mm and the same [0:15:07]
 zoom in we can get to the point. There we go this point and this point and take a length [0:15:15]
 the gain of 7mm. We are fully constrained. Let's close that and look at our next step and this [0:15:26]
 will be the pad. There's no point in padding to symmetry. So for instance if we pad this way and [0:15:33]
 take out this negative space then mirror it over the other side. Well it'll be just as quick to [0:15:40]
 pad all the way all the 21mm and then remove the negative space. We gain nothing with adding that [0:15:48]
 symmetry. All we gain is an extra action. It doesn't help us in any way. That's pad the object. [0:15:53]
 Taking the sketch, clicking the pad 21mm. [0:15:58]
 Looking at from the top you can see what's happening. We're coming in and looking at the [0:16:07]
 fillet and seeing where that sits. You can see that it sits off from this so we come back into that pad [0:16:15]
 and set the symmetry to plain and then okay. Now we can attack this shape from a different profile. [0:16:27]
 So from the left which is the front. I'm going to hide this fillet. So I've got nothing to [0:16:35]
 attach that profile on. We've got no face so I'm going to use the base planes. It's creating new [0:16:42]
 sketch looking at it from the left. New sketch and we're going to use the YZ plane. Notice that [0:16:50]
 the plane is reversed here. So I'll select that plane. It's going to flip me around the other side. [0:16:57]
 That's not a problem. So we can see where it's been placed. So what we need to do is look at it from [0:17:05]
 this direction because I want these points coming in. So the moment we're around this [0:17:12]
 place we've got reverse sketch. That's close that. Look at the sketch. Come down to map reverse [0:17:19]
 and set that to true. That means when I come into the sketch we're now looking at from the correct [0:17:25]
 direction. I can use my section view sketch view section. So I'll take away that material so I can [0:17:34]
 see inside and I'm going to reference these two of that face there because we need to keep this part [0:17:47]
 intact when we do the pocket. So now let's create a rectangle. Make sure that these two points [0:17:59]
 are in line. Horizontal constraint. Those are in line now. And if we can set these two points [0:18:08]
 symmetrical to this line. So just let one and then the other and the last one we make the [0:18:14]
 symmetrical to do. And then we can set a length in here of two millimeters. So this will be equal [0:18:22]
 to the width of this part here where it comes up. So we look at this we can see we've got two [0:18:28]
 millimeters wall here. So this one here. So that's two mil. The height we're not worried about [0:18:34]
 because we're taking material away. So as long as it's longer than this profile, [0:18:41]
 then we can rotate that material away. So I'm going to set them high in here. I can attach it [0:18:46]
 to the base. I'm just going to go for six millimeters. And if we look back that is actually the [0:18:54]
 right size because we got eight minus two. So we do have any problems. We just increase this size. [0:19:00]
 If we get a face that's left down here. So that's close. So our sketch is we can see there. It's [0:19:06]
 just in the center there and we use a pocket. But we need to bring it this way as well. [0:19:14]
 To do that we just go through all. That takes it all away this way. [0:19:20]
 Smetric to plane will take out the front as well. [0:19:25]
 Rough than just going this way when we create symmetrical plane it actually goes out [0:19:33]
 close symmetry and that actually goes out both sides. Taking away that material. That's okay that. [0:19:39]
 We're almost there. We just need to add the fillets. We can see we've got a top fillet radius [0:19:46]
 of one millimeter. Looking around we don't have any other fillets. If we were doing this from [0:19:53]
 a different profile of so attacking it from this side then we would have to fill it this here. [0:19:59]
 As well as this side here. So we're creating more features upon that. That's how the fillets [0:20:04]
 are taking this edge. Control select in the average and using the fillet tool. [0:20:09]
 We're for one millimeter fillet and okay. So we now got this object. That's bring the other [0:20:19]
 fillet back and we can see how they're going to sit. So linking in that previous fillet from the other [0:20:27]
 file we get an idea of how our model is going to look when it's going to be assembled. And now we can [0:20:33]
 see that the action set was taken compared to what we showed before. Our very simple we have a pad [0:20:42]
 a pocket and a final fillet. Looking back at the example we showed at the beginning [0:20:50]
 like consisted of a pad, a pocket, enough a pocket for the holes and the arc. [0:20:58]
 Because it was from this profile previous pocket was from this profile going downwards and then we added [0:21:06]
 the fillet to round off this feature here. Followed by enough a fillet, clean up the edge and then a mirror. [0:21:16]
 So you can see that we have a lot more actions in our tree. Whereas the previous part, [0:21:23]
 we have less actions. Therefore we have a more stable model. So if we change something say [0:21:31]
 in the pocket or in the pad, there's not much above it that can be affected. And if an aerodazacur [0:21:38]
 it can be more easy resolved than the other workflow. You've now completed part two and we can move on [0:21:44]
 to part three. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a co-fire or a [0:21:50]
