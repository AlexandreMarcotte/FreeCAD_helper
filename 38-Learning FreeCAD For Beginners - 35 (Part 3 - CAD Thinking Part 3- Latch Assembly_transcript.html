===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD For Beginners - 35 (Part 3 - CAD Thinking Part 3- Latch Assembly =====
 So in our previous video we tackled this part of the latch assembly. [0:00:05]
 We are now going to tackle the base part so this part here. [0:00:11]
 Our previous tutorial tool is that if we use a different profile we will get a different [0:00:18]
 effect. [0:00:20]
 Careful selection of the profile means we get less operations in the tree. [0:00:25]
 So we can tackle this object from different profiles. [0:00:29]
 So for instance if I tackled it from this side you can see we've got a pretty simple [0:00:34]
 profile to deal with. [0:00:36]
 Therefore we can take out this shape, utilising the negative spaces and then taking out these [0:00:48]
 holes. [0:00:50]
 All we could tackle it from this side, drawing this profile, coming around, taking out [0:00:59]
 the pockets, removing material from here, leaving these as triangles and then transferring [0:01:11]
 off the sides to leave this curve. [0:01:14]
 We also got the holes from the side to deal with. [0:01:18]
 So I'm going to be tackling it from the top, but I'm also going to show you what happens [0:01:23]
 when we tackled it from the front. [0:01:27]
 And how many operations we get between those. [0:01:30]
 So again careful selection of the profiles means we have less operations. [0:01:35]
 Therefore if we have less operations the model becomes more stable. [0:01:40]
 Let's now build this part. [0:01:43]

 So let's look at the workflow when we tackled it from this profile, this one here. [0:02:14]
 First let's have a look at the sketch. [0:02:17]
 You can see we're using symmetry to our vantage. [0:02:24]
 So we start with a sketch which is then padded. [0:02:28]
 The next thing is a pocket with this sketch. [0:02:31]
 So we're taking away this triangle here. [0:02:37]
 This creates this feature. [0:02:42]
 The next pocket is to place a hole in here. [0:02:47]
 Followed by this pocket here. [0:02:50]
 Now we could combine these together in one single pocket. [0:02:59]
 The next pocket is to take holes through the sides followed by the fillet to round off [0:03:07]
 this corner here. [0:03:11]
 The chamfer. [0:03:14]
 And finally, because we're working with symmetry, we use the mirror. [0:03:19]
 Let's see how many operations I'll reduce. [0:03:23]
 When we tackled the object from the top. [0:03:27]
 Again, we're using free CAD with the part design. [0:03:30]
 But if you're using any other CAD package, then the same principles apply. [0:03:36]
 Now if we look at this profile, we're going to be using symmetry because we have symmetry [0:03:40]
 across there. [0:03:42]
 And it's going to be beneficial for us to use it. [0:03:44]
 We don't always need to use symmetry. [0:03:47]
 And sometimes it's quicker not to use symmetry. [0:03:48]
 For instance, with this part, I can see that we've got a chamfer in here. [0:03:54]
 We've got this foot that goes around here, which we include in our sketch. [0:03:59]
 Then we're going to have to create this on both sides. [0:04:04]
 And then add the chamfer to this with both those holes in a single operation. [0:04:10]
 So be quicker and easier just to create one side. [0:04:14]
 If this was a rectangle, let's say if this was a rectangle that come out here, then I'll [0:04:19]
 just create a rectangle a slot and two holes. [0:04:23]
 And that'll be pretty simple to do. [0:04:26]
 Because we have the curvature in here, then we're going to take a different approach [0:04:31]
 and use symmetry and taking the advantage of mirroring. [0:04:35]
 So in the point design and I've created a new body and created a new sketch, we're [0:04:41]
 going to be tackling it from the top profile so we need the x-py plane. [0:04:44]
 And you'll see the sketch will rotate around to the top. [0:04:49]
 Before we do anything, we've got to get our viewpoint into the right dimensions. [0:04:53]
 To do that, there's one of two ways we can use the dimensions down here to get a [0:04:58]
 self into the correct dimensions as you see we can zoom in and out to get those correct [0:05:03]
 use method of placing down points onto our screen and dimension those and using a kind [0:05:10]
 of dot dot wave joining those up into our main sketch. [0:05:14]
 This is technique I'm going to use. [0:05:16]
 Look at the technical drawing, that's pick out our main dimensions. [0:05:20]
 So I've added this technical drawing here, this viewpoint, which is without the fillet. [0:05:25]
 So this shows me that this is 17mm long from this point and also we've got an 8mm [0:05:32]
 length here as well as the 21mm height. [0:05:38]
 So we can go 21, 8 and 17. [0:05:46]
 Also we need another one here for the 8 and we're going to keep these two in line with vertical [0:05:54]
 constraint and these two in line with horizontal constraint. [0:05:59]
 Actually we're going to keep this one in line as well. [0:06:01]
 So pick all three and place the horizontal constraint across all of those. [0:06:07]
 Make sure you're all to constraint on and you're avoid redundant autoconstraint [0:06:11]
 are on. [0:06:12]
 That's important because our horizontal constraints have already been applied with our [0:06:17]
 constraint that we've just done. [0:06:19]
 So any lines between them, our horizontal constraint will be removed and you won't have [0:06:23]
 to come out of the solver to remove it. [0:06:26]
 That sets the length in here so set in these two to 8mm. [0:06:34]
 And between these two, this going to be 17. [0:06:41]
 We can see straight away we're not in the right dimensions. [0:06:44]
 If I add 21mm to here, we need to zoom in and we get to our correct dimensions. [0:06:56]
 If we try to do this with our main sketch by just sketching in arcs and lines and then [0:07:03]
 dimension them, then we can get ourselves into a bit of a state where we have to keep [0:07:09]
 on resizing and changing where the arcs are and it can be a bit of a pain. [0:07:14]
 Get the main dimension down and get in your view point dimension correctly. [0:07:18]
 Make sure life a lot easier. [0:07:20]
 Let's start sketching in the geometry. [0:07:22]
 For that I'm going to follow this sketch. [0:07:24]
 And then add a fill it in halfwards using the polyline tool. [0:07:32]
 We'll create a sketch between here just by connecting up the points. [0:07:41]
 Now I've missed the left hand point and we're closer to geometry and that's fixed that. [0:07:50]
 So here's a scape. [0:07:51]
 Highlight those two points. [0:07:54]
 Make sure the lines aren't highlighted and use the quinscent constraint. [0:08:01]
 Everything is now constrained. [0:08:03]
 That's our fillet to here. [0:08:06]
 The fillets sit here so we've got a number of fillets. [0:08:09]
 We've got a sketch fillet and a constraint preserving sketch fillet. [0:08:13]
 This is the one we're going to use. [0:08:16]
 So we're using constraint preserving fillet and fillet off these points here. [0:08:23]
 We still got our constraint of 17mm and we can add our radius which is of 3mm. [0:08:36]
 Like so. [0:08:37]
 We're now constrained again and we can push this over to the side. [0:08:43]
 We can let's have a cool drawing. [0:08:44]
 We do have a hold here but we're unsure how far away it is from this point. [0:08:49]
 This two things you can do here. [0:08:51]
 Your first option is to add the hole and constrain it quinscent to this point here. [0:09:00]
 Or we can add a circle. [0:09:05]
 That's not constrained but using the sides. [0:09:10]
 In this edge we use tangent constraint and again on this side. [0:09:18]
 Like so. [0:09:20]
 Which means we have this shape that is tangent to those edges and we keep this point [0:09:29]
 centered between those edges. [0:09:33]
 We then change this to construction geometry. [0:09:36]
 We're using the construction geometry or sketch. [0:09:41]
 Sketch geometries, toggle and construction geometry. [0:09:45]
 This will turn blue and we can add a hole in the middle. [0:09:49]
 The construction geometry will just allow that hole to move if we drag this. [0:09:56]
 This will not show up when we exit the sketch. [0:10:00]
 The hole is 3mm in diameter. [0:10:02]
 Let's add that. [0:10:07]
 And we can position this where we want. [0:10:12]
 We also can come in and set a distance between these two. [0:10:18]
 Using the distance. [0:10:19]
 I'll say 2mm and we've got that one in there. [0:10:24]
 So we have control over this hole. [0:10:27]
 I've been sending across these two lines using tangent. [0:10:33]
 I'm going to set this just one minute and leave that like that for now. [0:10:38]
 We've got one more part and that's this slot shape here. [0:10:42]
 I'm going to use a subtractive method to remove that geometry. [0:10:45]
 So coming in and adding a slot. [0:10:51]
 In this gap, I'm using the trim. [0:10:55]
 So we can see the line is highlighted in yellow. [0:11:00]
 And we get a circle of where the new vertex is going to sit. [0:11:06]
 So that's all to constraint to this line. [0:11:09]
 Let's trim this line as well. [0:11:12]
 And remove what's left over. [0:11:15]
 Indulate. [0:11:17]
 These constraints will be lost so we need to place this point on this line. [0:11:22]
 To normal get constraint and do the same for this one as well. [0:11:33]
 Add horizontal constraint and we just need to dimension this. [0:11:38]
 Looking back at the technical drawing, we can see that this is in the middle. [0:11:42]
 So we need symmetry across there. [0:11:45]
 To make the symmetry, I'm going to use this point and this point. [0:11:50]
 And finally the middle point. [0:11:53]
 I use the symmetry constraint. [0:11:57]
 That's now symmetrical. [0:11:58]
 We can see if we pull this down this will grow because of the symmetry. [0:12:02]
 That's add this radius of 3.5. [0:12:07]
 Take any arc and set the radius of 3.5. [0:12:14]
 Now we're for the constraint. [0:12:18]
 We can close this and we've got our first sketch. [0:12:21]
 I'm just going to say the document. [0:12:25]
 I'm saving it as part 3. [0:12:32]
 The next step of our journey is to pad this. [0:12:36]
 So we're looking at the full height of the object which is 10mm. [0:12:41]
 Taking the sketch in the part design, we just add the pad. [0:12:46]
 And set that to 10mm and here I've got. [0:12:49]
 Now we've padded the object. [0:12:51]
 We can move round to another profile. [0:12:55]
 So we're going to come round to the front for you and we're going to tackle the object from [0:12:58]
 that profile. [0:13:00]
 So we're looking for symmetry and removing these parts here. [0:13:06]
 Now we've got one of two options. [0:13:07]
 We can add the sketch to the front of this face here or we could use the base plane. [0:13:12]
 I'm just going to use the base plane so I can make sure nothing's selected. [0:13:16]
 And we're creating a new sketch. [0:13:20]
 I'm looking along the XZ plane. [0:13:24]
 And we can see what we have. [0:13:27]
 As we started the modeling from the point of origin here, from the last sketch, [0:13:33]
 it'll be the same as placing that sketch upon that face. [0:13:39]
 That's great that profile. [0:13:41]
 If we look back at the technical drawing, you can see we have 17mm and 2mm here. [0:13:48]
 So we need to take this space and this space. [0:13:51]
 But there is enough a way around that. [0:13:54]
 We can actually sketch this and use basically a reverse pocket. [0:13:59]
 Let me show you how that works. [0:14:01]
 I'm going to use the polylind tool and start drawing that geometry. [0:14:05]
 I've added the sketch. [0:14:18]
 And now I'm going to add some constraints and bring it to geometry from the face. [0:14:27]
 So I'm going to bring this part here. [0:14:30]
 I'm also this edge here. [0:14:33]
 We know this length is 17mm. [0:14:44]
 And we have a 2mm height. [0:14:50]
 And this part is 8mm. [0:14:59]
 I can now constrain this geometry. [0:15:02]
 These points, quits and constraint and make these lines equal to equal height across there. [0:15:20]
 I'm also going to put a length in between these two, again of 2mm. [0:15:30]
 And now fully constrained. [0:15:32]
 But if I pocket this, we don't get the right result. [0:15:36]
 What we get is a multi-body object. [0:15:40]
 That's not a lad in free CAD and also we don't get the right shape. [0:15:44]
 We need the reverse of this. [0:15:45]
 So we need to use it like a cookie cutter. [0:15:47]
 That's simple to produce by creating a rectangle around here. [0:15:53]
 Therefore, this is space and the rest is removed. [0:16:01]
 We can add some constraints in here. [0:16:08]
 But I'm just going to leave it as it is. [0:16:11]
 Let's close that. [0:16:12]
 And we can see the shape that's going to be removed. [0:16:17]
 So all of this around the outside is going to be removed. [0:16:22]
 If I go for the pocket and go through all, we get the shape that's needed. [0:16:31]
 That's okay, that's. [0:16:33]
 And now we can create the holes. [0:16:37]
 To do that, we're going to use this face. [0:16:40]
 When we create the holes, because these faces are in a line, we just add the circles [0:16:44]
 to this. [0:16:45]
 So we can create a sketch for that face. [0:16:48]
 And I'm going to come in and add the holes. [0:16:52]
 One on each. [0:16:54]
 We're going to place them on that face for the time being. [0:16:56]
 And then we're going to constrain them. [0:16:59]
 Looking back at the technical drawing, we can see there in the middle of that face. [0:17:04]
 So we need to pull in some geometry. [0:17:06]
 I'm going to hit a skate to get them asked point about and use the important geometry tool. [0:17:11]
 Or external geometry. [0:17:13]
 I'm going to take the corners of these faces. [0:17:19]
 Like so. [0:17:26]
 And then I'm going to use symmetry. [0:17:28]
 Use the corners and the center point of the circle. [0:17:32]
 And create symmetry across there. [0:17:34]
 Let's do the same for the other one. [0:17:42]
 And now we can add the dimensions to these holes with the diameter of three millimeters. [0:17:52]
 We can close and finally pocket those. [0:17:57]
 We can go through all. [0:17:59]
 And here I can. [0:18:03]
 We're almost finished our part. [0:18:04]
 We just need to add the finishing operations. [0:18:09]
 And that includes the shampering here. [0:18:17]
 Using the shampitol of 0.5. [0:18:26]
 And looking back at the technical drawing we can see we've basically finished all we need to do [0:18:30]
 is add the mirror. [0:18:31]
 Now I can't do the point of our model where we're going to mirror over the other side. [0:18:36]
 Now this is where it's beneficial to keep those operations simple because to do a part [0:18:41]
 of the eye mirror we have to pick all the operations to allow us to mirror. [0:18:47]
 So all the operations that build up that model. [0:18:51]
 Come on to part design, apply pattern and mirror it. [0:18:56]
 You can see that the mirror is failing. [0:19:00]
 So there must be a reason for that to fail. [0:19:03]
 We can see over the left hand side we've got one transform shape does not intersect [0:19:06]
 the pull. [0:19:08]
 That's cancel that and go back for our tree to find the shape. [0:19:14]
 So we have the shampfer we have the pocket which I'm going to press spacebar on. [0:19:18]
 So I'm moving back through time. [0:19:20]
 Go this pocket here and then we've got the pad. [0:19:24]
 Let's have a look at this pocket and look at the sketch that we used. [0:19:30]
 Now if we look at this sketch it's actually going past this axis and this is our problem. [0:19:40]
 So if I can strain this down properly place it upon this axis point of mine constraint [0:19:48]
 and it will be best to constrain this right down so this will go green. [0:19:52]
 I think close in minutes we can see we've got some problems. [0:19:59]
 Go back in and one going to do is coming and we need to trim this. [0:20:10]
 So we're looking down here and it's trim this line. [0:20:16]
 So it all becomes one and this one. [0:20:23]
 So it's created this shape as half a cookie cutter basically. [0:20:29]
 Let's close that and we can see the error has now disappeared. [0:20:39]
 Now when we come back to the pad and control slept all the other operations and use [0:20:46]
 the mirroring that operation is successful and you can see that they are in sequence to [0:20:53]
 go their pad the pocket for the by the second pocket and last fold the chamfer. [0:20:59]
 And the mirroring has taken effect. [0:21:02]
 I say okay and we finished our part if we wanted to we can come back into the mirror and [0:21:10]
 set the refined to true and this will remove these faces because they're long the same [0:21:16]
 plane and merge them into one and we see that along here as well. [0:21:22]
 So that's the part finished. [0:21:27]
 So from that lesson you've learnt how to use a reverse pocket. [0:21:30]
 Learned about some of the problems that you can have from mirroring so we must make sure [0:21:33]
 that everything is to one side of that axis if we build in symmetrical part. [0:21:39]
 And we've also learnt what profile to slept. [0:21:42]
 In our next video we're going to be looking at the final part before assembly. [0:21:47]
