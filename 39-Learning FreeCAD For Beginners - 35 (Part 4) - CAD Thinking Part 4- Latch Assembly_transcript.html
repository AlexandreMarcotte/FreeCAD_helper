===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD For Beginners - 35 (Part 4) - CAD Thinking Part 4- Latch Assembly =====
 So now we are on our very last part for the modelling and then we can get onto the assembly. [0:00:04]
 This time we're going to model this clip here. [0:00:07]
 So that's how we look at the part in more detail. [0:00:10]
 If we look at the shape we can see it's basically a bar that's been bent into shape. [0:00:14]
 To model this it looks like it's going to be a bit tricky. [0:00:17]
 If we look at the profiles from the front we can't see that we can model the whole object from the front [0:00:25]
 because we have this curvature that goes along here. [0:00:28]
 If we look from the top we can't see that we can model it from the top either. [0:00:34]
 Because if we look at the profiles we're looking at the planes and how many points line that plane. [0:00:41]
 So we've just sketched out the planes upon it. [0:00:45]
 We can see how that sits flat on that plane at these points here. [0:00:51]
 But we can't sketch upon that plane because this is curved. [0:00:55]
 So sketch this is one object. It's not possible. [0:00:59]
 Let's take that away and look at a different profile say from the XZ plane. [0:01:04]
 So if we laid this plane and what we'll do is just offset this from the centre. [0:01:10]
 And this is exactly the same as what we were doing if we were sketching. [0:01:15]
 So let's move it this way. [0:01:18]
 So we start to see the object appear in that plane. [0:01:22]
 You can see that well it curves this way. [0:01:25]
 So we can't create that profile or can we. [0:01:30]
 If we break this down into the individual parts rather than think this is a whole object then it starts become clear. [0:01:37]
 I've actually set the view modes of this object. [0:01:40]
 So you can see we've got a flat line for you for this panel and a simple shader view for this. [0:01:47]
 When I start to hover over the different sections you can see what's happening. [0:01:53]
 So this is actually sectioned out. [0:01:56]
 And through this we can pick out parts of this object and build it out with two or more sketches on different planes. [0:02:05]
 Let me just move this plane. [0:02:10]
 So we just can transform this. [0:02:15]
 And move this up. [0:02:17]
 So we are now on that plane with this part going along here. [0:02:22]
 It okay. [0:02:25]
 So that can actually be a sketch upon this plane and then we looked this side and then we have to deal with the top view. [0:02:35]
 We can't deal with it directly from the top. [0:02:38]
 So we need to create a sketch for the part of this. [0:02:42]
 Now if we look and bring this around so it's slightly diagonal. [0:02:50]
 We can see if we draw a line here a straight line down. [0:02:54]
 This is on that plane. [0:02:56]
 So we can sketch this part and this part. [0:03:01]
 As two sketches, join them together in a free space and create this object. [0:03:07]
 If we look at the technical drawing, [0:03:10]
 we can see the shape that we need is just a sketch. [0:03:15]
 And because the profile of this object, so looking at the cross section of this bar, [0:03:20]
 is just basically a circle. [0:03:22]
 We use a sweep workflow. [0:03:25]
 So create a circle profile and sweep it along this path. [0:03:29]
 So what we've got to do is look at both the shape of the object and also the cross section of the object, [0:03:35]
 to understand how to model that in a free space. [0:03:39]
 So we model in this part here and this part that comes around here. [0:03:47]
 And we just need to rotate this so it points this way and connects our tangent with our other sketch. [0:03:55]
 This will become clear in the demonstration. [0:03:58]
 Let's start modeling this part. [0:04:00]

 For this demonstration, we're using the part design again. [0:04:28]
 I've already created new document and saved it as part 4. [0:04:32]
 We couldn't come up to the view and toggle the access cross. [0:04:38]
 So we can see the center of our scene. [0:04:41]
 Looking at the technical drawing for reference, we're going to use this part for our first sketch. [0:04:49]
 We've got some dimensions in here so if you had the rule of objects in front view, [0:04:53]
 you would just be measuring those up. [0:04:55]
 So we've got 20mm along this edge and a radius of 3mm. [0:05:01]
 So remember we need to break the status of primitives or match the geometry to our sketch tools. [0:05:07]
 We've got sketch geometry here which are just lines and arcs. [0:05:11]
 Or if we think about this, this is basically a rectangle with rounded corners. [0:05:17]
 Back in the part design, we can create a new body and create our first sketch. [0:05:22]
 Now I'm going to place this along the x, y-planks. [0:05:25]
 We're looking down on the object and we want to create this rounded rectangle shape. [0:05:30]
 The good thing is that we have that in our sketcher, rounded rectangle. [0:05:37]
 Or we could just use a line with arcs. [0:05:42]
 Get us all centered and put our first geometry down on the page. [0:05:47]
 Before we go anywhere, we need to add some constraints because we're not sure we're at the right size yet. [0:05:53]
 So I'm going to add some radius constraints to this one. [0:05:56]
 We'll look at constraints of this object. [0:05:58]
 We can see we've got a quality constraint here. [0:06:01]
 So 13 goes across all of these arcs. [0:06:05]
 And we've got 15 down here as well. [0:06:09]
 But remember we only need parts of this object. [0:06:12]
 So I want this radius here and this line and this one here. [0:06:15]
 So I'm going to remove this geometry here. [0:06:18]
 To do that, we can use the box selection. [0:06:21]
 So a box set here, it sleds these edges and these points will be in that selection. [0:06:27]
 It didn't slet this part here because the whole of that edge wasn't inside the box selection. [0:06:33]
 There is enough way of selecting and that's from the bottom up. [0:06:38]
 So from right to left. [0:06:41]
 And you can see that whatever that bounding box touches will be removed. [0:06:49]
 So we've got two ways of selecting. [0:06:53]
 So let's take all those edges that that bounding box touches and hit the lead. [0:06:59]
 Now we're left with this here. [0:07:02]
 You notice there's a constraints of disappeared for this curve because we had the constraints going across both. [0:07:07]
 So they would link constraints as take both of these curves, both of these arcs and set a radius of 3mm. [0:07:19]
 Now we can set up this length. [0:07:21]
 So this length was 20mm. [0:07:26]
 So this art going around here is where the connection is going to be. [0:07:31]
 So the connection is going to be going this way. [0:07:34]
 So this needs to be tangent with this line to make this smooth transition because it doesn't come out this way. [0:07:41]
 If we look we can see it's got smooth transition. [0:07:45]
 So this curve here will be this side just curves outwards and connects up to this part. [0:07:53]
 To do that, let's take these points and keep them in line. [0:07:57]
 So taking all four of those points and using a vertical constraint. [0:08:03]
 Let's keep this symmetrical. [0:08:05]
 So by taking this point and this point and the center point and using a symmetry. [0:08:12]
 And now we're fully constrained. [0:08:15]
 Let's close that and see what we have. [0:08:17]
 So we have this shape here. [0:08:22]
 So now we're going to first sketch. [0:08:24]
 We need to create the other side. [0:08:27]
 So this side here. [0:08:29]
 For that we're just going to add these arcs to start with. [0:08:33]
 But we're not going to add them to the same sketch because we're going to need to rotate it in this direction. [0:08:39]
 So if we take this part you can see it's rotated 45 degrees up this way. [0:08:44]
 This part is rotated 45 degrees up this way as well. [0:08:48]
 So they've got both different rotation points. [0:08:52]
 So we need to create a separate sketch. [0:08:54]
 To do that, let's come back into the part design. [0:08:57]
 And create a new sketch along the x-flight plane. [0:09:01]
 And okay. [0:09:03]
 We can see our sketch is in here. [0:09:05]
 So that's create our arcs. [0:09:07]
 We're going to be using this axis here because we need to rotate it. [0:09:12]
 So we need to center a rotation in the middle. [0:09:15]
 And point a pinpoint arc. [0:09:17]
 And we're going to create the verse of this. [0:09:20]
 So we want them coming around this way and connecting up. [0:09:26]
 Like so. [0:09:28]
 But remember that this needs to be on this line here. [0:09:33]
 So we're just going to use this line for reference, visual reference. [0:09:37]
 Let's make the radius of those 3mm. [0:09:44]
 And we need to keep these two in line. [0:09:49]
 Horizons are constraint. [0:09:53]
 And let's bring them this round here somewhere. [0:09:56]
 And we need to keep these two in line with horizontal constraint. [0:10:02]
 And these two in line horizontal constraint. [0:10:06]
 We're going to do the same with these points. [0:10:09]
 Keep them vertical. [0:10:14]
 So all those are in line. [0:10:16]
 So we can move those now. [0:10:18]
 And we need to position these properly. [0:10:21]
 So we know the distance between these two. [0:10:26]
 It's going to be 20mm. [0:10:31]
 So it's the same distance here. [0:10:34]
 And now we're going to attach these two points to this line. [0:10:39]
 So this point and this point, we're going to attach this line. [0:10:43]
 Let's do a point on line constraint. [0:10:45]
 But we've got the horizontal constraint so we don't have to worry about it. [0:10:49]
 Now we can take these two points and the center point. [0:10:53]
 And keep them constrained symmetrically. [0:10:57]
 So we've got these two arcs. [0:10:59]
 You may look a bit weird because we got the other curve underneath there. [0:11:03]
 But this will all come apparent in a moment. [0:11:06]
 So we have that sketch. [0:11:09]
 It sits there. [0:11:11]
 Looking back, we can see we've got 17mm between this point and this point. [0:11:17]
 So this add that to our sketch. [0:11:19]
 So we need to create some distance away with this sketch. [0:11:22]
 Looking at the position and looking along the x axis. [0:11:30]
 17mm. [0:11:35]
 So we've got that there. [0:11:38]
 The reason why I didn't use that in this sketch. [0:11:42]
 Say offset it from here. [0:11:45]
 17mm is because the center rotation for this sketch will still be in here this way. [0:11:51]
 If we did it via the sketch, then we're offsetting from this vertical axis this way. [0:11:57]
 And when we rotate the center rotation will back here. [0:12:03]
 So in line with the axis cross. [0:12:06]
 So our rotation will be awkward to get right. [0:12:09]
 Now we've got these. [0:12:11]
 We can start adding our arcs. [0:12:13]
 So I'm going to create a new sketch for the arc and go this way. [0:12:18]
 And we can pull these in as tangent constraints. [0:12:24]
 We're doing creating this arc here, not this section of this section because those are being created with our other sketches. [0:12:30]
 And then creating tangency with this arc as a projected line. [0:12:37]
 So when we use the import geometry, we import that arc in. [0:12:41]
 So looking from the front, we create a new sketch. [0:12:46]
 The long the x-zpling. [0:12:48]
 And okay. [0:12:50]
 It's placed us in the center of our scene. [0:12:54]
 So in the center of this line here, which is fine because we just changed this fire offset or attachment. [0:13:01]
 I'm going to pull in these arcs and that will create a plan of geometry along that line. [0:13:07]
 They're using the external geometry tool. [0:13:10]
 Pull in both these arcs. [0:13:12]
 Now what we can do is create an endpoint and endpoint arc. [0:13:17]
 Remember we've got the order constraints on. [0:13:19]
 And we'll hover over that point to make quintest and constraint. [0:13:22]
 Hover over this point to make quintest and create our arc. [0:13:29]
 So we've got this arc in here. [0:13:31]
 We want tangency across these lines. [0:13:34]
 So I'll take this line and this line and make a tangent constraint. [0:13:38]
 We've got a removal of constraint. [0:13:41]
 If I hit okay, you can see we've got a solver failed to converge. [0:13:45]
 And that's because we have an attachment across two straight lines. [0:13:50]
 We can't create that tangency in there just yet. [0:13:53]
 So I'm just going to control said that. [0:13:56]
 Or we can delete that constraint. [0:13:58]
 That's make sure that this is still connected. [0:14:01]
 Which it looks like it is. [0:14:03]
 So what I'm going to do is just change this line here. [0:14:08]
 And have this angled upwards to do that. [0:14:12]
 We need to angle these arcs. [0:14:14]
 And this is where we're angle in this 45 degrees ball. [0:14:17]
 We're going to take it slowly. [0:14:19]
 So we can see what happens. [0:14:21]
 Let's close that. [0:14:22]
 Let's click on this sketch. [0:14:26]
 And at the moment if I come down to the attachment and down to the angle. [0:14:30]
 And that's put this say at 10 degrees. [0:14:33]
 You can see it's rotating along the wrong axis. [0:14:36]
 We need to change the axis. [0:14:38]
 So we look at the axis. [0:14:39]
 We got a one at the moment in the z. [0:14:41]
 So positive one. [0:14:42]
 So it's rotating around the z axis in the positive manner. [0:14:46]
 So the z axis runs normal sketch this way. [0:14:51]
 So we need to place this one in the y and a zero in the z. [0:14:59]
 So we look at that now. [0:15:00]
 We can see it's rotated down this way. [0:15:03]
 Let's change that. [0:15:04]
 Now can I have to do minus on the y. [0:15:07]
 But I'm going to use the angle. [0:15:11]
 So we have the angle there because these two will be the same angle. [0:15:17]
 But one will be positive. [0:15:20]
 And one will be negative. [0:15:22]
 So the axis we need to one in the y. [0:15:25]
 And a zero in the z. [0:15:28]
 Notice the arc changed the arc changed position. [0:15:32]
 That's coming to that arc. [0:15:34]
 So this one here double click it. [0:15:36]
 You see it's still connected. [0:15:38]
 Now we've got some angle in this. [0:15:41]
 We can apply the tangency. [0:15:45]
 And the tangency here as well. [0:15:49]
 Like so. [0:15:52]
 Closing that. [0:15:53]
 That's now tangent. [0:15:54]
 If we look from the front with this line. [0:15:57]
 So these arcs. [0:15:58]
 So these arcs here. [0:15:59]
 We just need to offset this. [0:16:02]
 So I can use a attachment or I can just use the attachment offset by coming into the position. [0:16:12]
 Looking along the y axis. [0:16:18]
 And we'll move that. [0:16:19]
 You can see it's not moving correctly at the moment because more we've done is used the y axis of the sketch. [0:16:26]
 This is the local coordinate system moving along the y didn't work. [0:16:31]
 Because we sketched upon this plane. [0:16:33]
 So z runs this way in local coordinate system. [0:16:38]
 So we're coming to that sketch. [0:16:41]
 You can see that the axis here and the green is the y which we moved to the long. [0:16:48]
 So we've got to move this along the z. [0:16:51]
 Let's just control z at that moment. [0:16:55]
 You can see also it's broken the sketch. [0:16:59]
 So that's zero that out. [0:17:01]
 Click off. [0:17:02]
 That's back to normal. [0:17:04]
 And take that and move it along the z. [0:17:09]
 So we can move this. [0:17:11]
 13mm this way. [0:17:14]
 That's now in position. [0:17:17]
 And I'm going to take that sketch. [0:17:21]
 And duplicate the selected item. [0:17:24]
 Well, the selected object. [0:17:26]
 We don't need all of these. [0:17:27]
 We just need sketch zero zero two. [0:17:29]
 So I'm checking them all. [0:17:31]
 Until we get sketch zero zero two. [0:17:33]
 That's just got the ray square on. [0:17:36]
 So that's selected. [0:17:37]
 Okay, that. [0:17:38]
 We have this one now. [0:17:40]
 At the moment it's at 13. [0:17:43]
 And we can do minus 13 to place it over the other side. [0:17:48]
 Now we've got this curvature between these. [0:17:52]
 If I come into the sketch. [0:17:56]
 Say this one here. [0:17:59]
 And change the angle. [0:18:02]
 Do 45 degrees. [0:18:04]
 And do the same for the other one. [0:18:07]
 1 is 45 degrees. [0:18:12]
 We can see the sketches of the file. [0:18:14]
 So that's coming to that sketch. [0:18:16]
 And we have a little bit of what's happened. [0:18:20]
 Let's delete one of the tangent seats. [0:18:24]
 And you can see. [0:18:27]
 We have that arc there. [0:18:30]
 So we're going to do is take this point. [0:18:32]
 And this point. [0:18:34]
 Quintston. [0:18:36]
 The reason why this is not working is because the angle and the length of those imported geometry. [0:18:41]
 For creating arc all the way through there, you'll notice that the arc will actually [0:18:45]
 extend down below the line. [0:18:47]
 So because we can't have tangent seats across both these lines, one way around this is to actually create two arcs. [0:18:53]
 So we're going to delete this arc and create another arc. [0:19:01]
 And also another one. [0:19:03]
 Those are the moment I'll quintston with Chava. [0:19:05]
 And then we're going to use this line and this arc. [0:19:08]
 We've tangent C. [0:19:11]
 This arc and this arc. [0:19:13]
 We've tangent C. [0:19:15]
 And then this arc and this line. [0:19:17]
 We've tangent C as well. [0:19:21]
 Therefore we have tangent C all the way across there. [0:19:24]
 And we could decide basically where the split is. [0:19:29]
 When we do the sweep, this will create two parts to this sweep on the long list edge. [0:19:36]
 So the time being, we're just going to go with the standard single arc. [0:19:41]
 That connects up. [0:19:45]
 Quintston and tangent C. [0:19:49]
 So that's closed that and do the same on the other side. [0:19:51]
 So we've got exclamation mark on there and saying, [0:19:54]
 solving the sketch failed. [0:19:55]
 Still click that. [0:19:58]
 And delete this tangent C. [0:20:02]
 And take this point and this point and make them Quintston. [0:20:08]
 So that's fully constrained now. [0:20:13]
 Let's close that and see what we have. [0:20:15]
 So we now have the shape that we need for the sweep. [0:20:20]
 So we have all the sizes in here. [0:20:22]
 We've got 17 millimeters away from these two points. [0:20:25]
 Radishes, a free millimeters, 20 millimeters length. [0:20:30]
 And now we just need to use the profile along here. [0:20:34]
 So this is just going to be a circle profile. [0:20:36]
 You can see we've got a free millimeter length on this one. [0:20:40]
 So this one, I believe, is two millimeters. [0:20:44]
 And also we need to deal with this gaping here. [0:20:48]
 I'm going to show you quite an easy way where we can add part of that sweep. [0:20:52]
 So that's how to have the profile. [0:20:54]
 First of all, I'm going to rename these. [0:21:01]
 As the path. [0:21:03]
 It's a path one. [0:21:08]
 Path two, path three. [0:21:09]
 So now I've renamed all four paths. [0:21:12]
 That's great the profile. [0:21:14]
 We're going to do that with a new sketch. [0:21:17]
 And we're going to go along the exit plane because the profile needs to sit here. [0:21:23]
 So we're going to use a sweep profile. [0:21:25]
 This is the cross section of this piece, which is constant all the way around. [0:21:30]
 Except plane. [0:21:34]
 And it's basically a circle. [0:21:36]
 So come in. [0:21:38]
 Create the circle attached to the center point. [0:21:41]
 And set the diameter of this to two millimeters. [0:21:51]
 This is our path. [0:21:53]
 We want to sweep around. [0:21:54]
 But we're going to hear a problem. [0:21:58]
 That's clearly rename that to profile. [0:22:04]
 Now create our sweep, which is known as an additive pipe. [0:22:09]
 This one here. [0:22:12]
 First let the profile. [0:22:14]
 And we can select it from the additive feature and additive pipe. [0:22:19]
 The profile has been pulled in. [0:22:21]
 And now we can add the edge. [0:22:23]
 But we're going to hit a problem. [0:22:24]
 I see it added. [0:22:25]
 Let's let it have first edge. [0:22:27]
 We can see that's coming. [0:22:29]
 Add edge. [0:22:30]
 And next edge. [0:22:32]
 Just being pulled in. [0:22:34]
 Add edge gained. [0:22:36]
 This edge. [0:22:37]
 So this is all one sketch. [0:22:39]
 This part here. [0:22:40]
 Now we get onto our second sketch. [0:22:43]
 These lines here. [0:22:45]
 If we look path to sweep, it's only got one object in your path one. [0:22:49]
 So if I add the edge of this one, we get a problem. [0:22:53]
 It doesn't actually add it in because it's only wanting one object. [0:22:57]
 How do we get around that? [0:22:59]
 Let's cancel that. [0:23:01]
 And think about what we need to do. [0:23:03]
 We need to connect up all of these lines. [0:23:07]
 And all of these curves. [0:23:09]
 To do that, there is a tool called the Sub-Shapider, [0:23:13]
 which binds shapes into one across multiple geometry or multiple edges, etc. [0:23:19]
 So I'm going to select all of these. [0:23:22]
 Half one, half two, three and four. [0:23:25]
 It's made one single path. [0:23:28]
 Also available on create a Sub-Shapider or create a Sub-Object shape. [0:23:34]
 You'll see a binder has appeared if I keep these slats in just press the space bar that hides them all. [0:23:40]
 And, no hidden them. [0:23:42]
 We can see we still got binder left, which is a single object. [0:23:47]
 Now when I click the profile and use the added sweep, the profile goes in, add edge, [0:23:56]
 and we can add the edges to this from a single object. [0:24:01]
 But it's still a quick real object and select the object. [0:24:05]
 And the whole lot has swept. [0:24:08]
 Let's hit OK. [0:24:10]
 And now we have our sweep. [0:24:13]
 We've come to the path and project where we need to create this feature here. [0:24:19]
 So this is just an extension out of what we've already done with the additive pipe and then this disk. [0:24:26]
 We can see that we've got two millimeter length to add plus a three millimeter diameter of disk, [0:24:32]
 which is one millimeter in length. [0:24:35]
 We don't have to add a sketch for this. [0:24:38]
 This can be done with a standard pad. [0:24:40]
 So if we look at our model, we can see that this face here, if we click on the top, [0:24:47]
 it's all on one plane. [0:24:49]
 So draw a line here, it's all on one plane. [0:24:51]
 That means when I click on the pad, this will pad forwards. [0:24:56]
 And we can set that to two millimeters. [0:24:59]
 And click off, and that's padded forwards. [0:25:03]
 And so OK, that's. [0:25:05]
 And now we have the pad. [0:25:07]
 We can do exactly the same on the other side as well. [0:25:10]
 But what we're going to do is just finish this side first. [0:25:13]
 I'm going to create a sketch on this face. [0:25:17]
 Create a new sketch. [0:25:20]
 It's placed me right in the center of there. [0:25:22]
 So we're actually on that face the same on that face. [0:25:26]
 We just need to do a section view for the sketch view section. [0:25:31]
 And now I can create my circle on here by pulling in some external geometry. [0:25:39]
 And creating the circle. [0:25:41]
 So circle touch here and circle out. [0:25:44]
 And with this, we come over to the diameter and set this to free. [0:25:51]
 Let's close that. [0:25:53]
 And now with that sketch selected, we can pad by a millimeter. [0:26:00]
 And we're created that feature there. [0:26:03]
 We can repeat that on this side. [0:26:06]
 All we can use mirror. [0:26:07]
 Remember I didn't use symmetry across here, and though we could. [0:26:10]
 But it was easy enough to sketch that anyway. [0:26:12]
 And also going through the process a couple of times, just concrete that in the origin. [0:26:17]
 As this is symmetrical. [0:26:19]
 Bring about the access cross. [0:26:22]
 We can just use these two features. [0:26:25]
 So the pad. [0:26:26]
 Control-click the next pad. [0:26:28]
 So those two there. [0:26:29]
 Those are the last operations that we did. [0:26:31]
 And then use the mirror. [0:26:34]
 If we look, we want to mirror over the XZ plane. [0:26:39]
 So at the moment it's base XY. [0:26:42]
 We zoom out. [0:26:43]
 Can't really see where it's gone. [0:26:45]
 So let's go base XZ. [0:26:48]
 And we can see that features come across. [0:26:51]
 And hit OK. [0:26:53]
 We have now completed that part. [0:26:56]
 And we're ready to move on to assembling these in an assembly workbench. [0:27:02]
 And that will be in our next video. [0:27:04]
 So I hope you enjoyed that. [0:27:05]
