===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 4 - Tracing Photo - Image to Build a Simple Model =====
 Hi everyone, welcome to part 4 of the Learning FreeCAD for Beginners. [0:00:03]
 We'll be teaching the fundamentals of freecad, but doing that in a practical way by understanding [0:00:08]
 workflows. [0:00:09]
 In today's tutorial we'll be going through a workflow that allows us to trace an image [0:00:14]
 fire. [0:00:15]
 Important in the image workbench, whether it be a photograph, an illustration, etc. [0:00:20]
 The image workbench will allow us to load up the reference images on the different planes [0:00:25]
 and scale them to the correct scale, which will then allow us to trace them in the sketcher. [0:00:31]
 We'll be using standard sketched geometry, including construction geometry which allows us to [0:00:36]
 constrain our sketch. [0:00:38]
 Much more easier than a lane, a number of button constraints down, especially when we have an awkward [0:00:43]
 shape. [0:00:44]
 We'll then be output in that sketch to a part, design workflow to create the finished object. [0:00:51]
 By the end of this tutorial you'll be able to trace a exhaust flange, so we've got the finished [0:00:56]
 output on the left and the sketch has been created on the right. [0:01:00]
 We'll be doing this from an illustration of a exhaust flange with known dimensions just for the [0:01:06]
 circle in the middle. [0:01:09]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:01:34]
 When it comes to sketching external images and freecat we need to take account of composition, [0:01:39]
 scale and clarity of our image. [0:01:42]
 For instance this image is perfect if we want to trace this object because we're taking [0:01:47]
 a picture of the image directly above it and we're looking straight down on the image so [0:01:52]
 we haven't got any perspective issues there. [0:01:55]
 The only thing this is missing is a scale. [0:01:57]
 I can take that scale from the original object because I've got it here in front of me and [0:02:01]
 I know the dimensions of the object. [0:02:04]
 But if we didn't we need to scale in there so placing like a ruler or something like [0:02:08]
 a coin we can actually get the scale there but we need to position it properly to get [0:02:13]
 the correct scale for our perspective. [0:02:15]
 Using objects such as this we have the scale on the base of where that object sits. [0:02:21]
 This is no good because this object has depth then our scale will be out. [0:02:26]
 It will be much better to place the scale on a piece of paper and place that on top of [0:02:31]
 the object. [0:02:32]
 The other thing that we have to be wary of is how we're taking the shot and how we're [0:02:35]
 sitting on that shot. [0:02:37]
 So for instance this one you can see the sides of the object. [0:02:41]
 We're not directly above it. [0:02:43]
 We're not shooting directly down on the object so our perspective as well as our rotation [0:02:48]
 is out. [0:02:49]
 For this video I'm using an illustration of a flange so this is an exhaust flange. [0:02:55]
 We're going to be using that image which is going to be available for you to download [0:02:59]
 and through this we're going to be learning base it sketching and also how to use construction [0:03:04]
 geometry. [0:03:05]
 So we'll start tracing will be utilizing a workbench called the image workbench. [0:03:11]
 First we need a new document in freecat. [0:03:13]
 We'll use this icon here or file new. [0:03:17]
 We're going to come over to the image workbench and you'll find that the image workbench [0:03:23]
 is a simple workbench of just free icons here. [0:03:26]
 The first one creates an image and places a new tab. [0:03:29]
 We'll be using these two here. [0:03:32]
 This one is creating an image plane. [0:03:34]
 This is a great image plane on the different planes that are available in freecat. [0:03:38]
 Click that and we'll select the image which is at the moment as a PNG so it preserves [0:03:43]
 any transparency and we've got a very image type to look at that from. [0:03:46]
 That's open that. [0:03:47]
 It will ask us what plane we want to put it on and I want the x5 plane. [0:03:52]
 We can see the cube here is pointing downwards that's highlighted the top and we'll [0:03:56]
 have a cube over here. [0:03:57]
 We'll want it from looking down to looking down on the object. [0:04:00]
 Okay. [0:04:01]
 At image it's been placed on screen. [0:04:04]
 But it is not to scale. [0:04:06]
 We next have to find an element on here that is to scale. [0:04:11]
 I know that this circle is 70mm in diameter. [0:04:16]
 I'll be using that to scale. [0:04:18]
 To do that we'll use this icon here. [0:04:21]
 Scolar image plane. [0:04:22]
 If we click it you'll ask us to set the distance. [0:04:27]
 So in here I'm going to put 70mm and then it's going to ask us to select the first [0:04:31]
 point. [0:04:32]
 So into the image and we need to click once. [0:04:35]
 So I'm going to click once around here. [0:04:39]
 This is just to get a rough scale because we'll be feeling in the other geometry in the [0:04:42]
 moment. [0:04:44]
 And once I've clicked it's going to ask us to select the second point. [0:04:49]
 Now you may get a red line so you can see that red line now. [0:04:52]
 I've just tweaked the viewpoint to be a different place and I can select where I want [0:05:01]
 to place. [0:05:02]
 So I'm going to go from the top looking down and I can set that. [0:05:07]
 If you don't see that red line we can still select and then select the next one. [0:05:11]
 Just make some life a little easier and click. [0:05:14]
 So we've got that position. [0:05:16]
 Another reason we want to see that red line if I click on this image and come down to [0:05:21]
 our placement. [0:05:22]
 I can this up any other position open this up. [0:05:26]
 Then if I just change the Z axis you can see that's moved and that's because it's [0:05:30]
 behind it. [0:05:32]
 So if this is reached up above the Z or whatever axis you're looking at we can just drop [0:05:36]
 that and you'll see that line there. [0:05:39]
 Let's click top again. [0:05:42]
 Now we need to select an image plane so we can come over and select it. [0:05:45]
 It's already selected. [0:05:46]
 Just click it, isn't. [0:05:48]
 And if we look down towards the X and Y size of this image, if I hit OK you'll see that [0:05:56]
 change. [0:05:57]
 Now in the correct scale. [0:06:00]
 We can check that by using the measure tool, measure distance and come in and select. [0:06:07]
 You'll probably see another issue here is that our mouse pointer is where cross-airs [0:06:13]
 is white. [0:06:14]
 We can't really see what's going on. [0:06:16]
 If I add some angle to that you can see that's 69.25 and that's about right. [0:06:24]
 So I'm happy with that. [0:06:25]
 Click on the distance and hit the lead. [0:06:27]
 It doesn't have to be totally accurate. [0:06:29]
 It just gets in that ballpark. [0:06:31]
 Now we've ready to use the sketched traces image. [0:06:33]
 Let's go into the sketch of webinch. [0:06:35]
 Then drop down and we're going to create a new sketch. [0:06:39]
 Now make sure this image plane isn't selected. [0:06:41]
 Otherwise it's in the touch of the image plane. [0:06:43]
 But if it is and we go up to sketch, create sketch then it's not the end of the world. [0:06:49]
 We can change this to don't touch. [0:06:54]
 And hit OK. [0:06:55]
 So create a new sketch, just ask us what plane to place it upon and we want it on the [0:07:00]
 x-fibling. [0:07:01]
 So the top plane. [0:07:02]
 We're looking at here. [0:07:04]
 Hit OK. [0:07:05]
 The sketch will be created but you can see that our image is encended. [0:07:09]
 In this case we come over to the model tab. [0:07:12]
 Click on the image plane. [0:07:13]
 Come down to the placement. [0:07:15]
 Come down to the position. [0:07:17]
 Open that up and start nudging the x and y until we are in the center. [0:07:24]
 I'm going to say that's about right there. [0:07:26]
 Now this point you may want to start sketching from down here. [0:07:31]
 The center point is where we're going to constrain everything too. [0:07:36]
 And it's important because we want to know how to create this. [0:07:40]
 We have some symmetry across the image. [0:07:43]
 I know for a fact that this circle is 70 millimeters. [0:07:49]
 So I'm going to use that as a point of constrain. [0:07:51]
 So I'm going to constrain the circle that starts to this center point. [0:07:56]
 To do that I'm going to come over to this circle. [0:07:59]
 Click it and come down. [0:08:02]
 Now straight away you're going to see an issue. [0:08:04]
 We've got a white cross hairs. [0:08:06]
 So when I start entering this white we lose it. [0:08:10]
 We can do is come out from the model. [0:08:11]
 Click on the image plane and then click on view. [0:08:16]
 You'll find a number of options in here. [0:08:18]
 We've got bound in box display mode, etc. [0:08:23]
 We come down. [0:08:24]
 We've got transparency and we can drop this transparency. [0:08:28]
 By using the up and down arrow keys we can just the value. [0:08:31]
 So in like 36. [0:08:32]
 Therefore we can see our cross hairs. [0:08:38]
 That means that we've got a better chance of sketching this easily. [0:08:42]
 The other way to do it is to come into the edit preferences. [0:08:49]
 On the left hand side you'll notice a sketcher icon because we've opened up the sketcher [0:08:54]
 so it would be added to our preferences at that time. [0:08:58]
 Click that and we've got colors. [0:09:01]
 We can change the cursor cross hairs. [0:09:03]
 We may need to also change the edge because under constraint is white and we've got a white [0:09:09]
 image. [0:09:10]
 By going through the transparency method first. [0:09:12]
 Let's just cancel out of that. [0:09:16]
 Let's start sketching. [0:09:17]
 So I've got the circle geometry selected. [0:09:20]
 I've got the auto constraints on. [0:09:23]
 So in edit controls we've got the auto constraints on. [0:09:25]
 Means when I hover over that point we get the quinsant and the quinsant and the quinsant [0:09:29]
 and you can match those to the tool bar here. [0:09:32]
 So I'm quinsant to that center point. [0:09:34]
 We click once to attach it and then bring this out and click when we get to the circle. [0:09:42]
 As you can see we're not fully centered with this circle. [0:09:46]
 But that's fine. [0:09:47]
 I'm going to hit the right mouse button or hit the scape. [0:09:49]
 I'll get the mouse button back and click on this circle and add a diameter to it. [0:09:57]
 Draw this down. [0:09:59]
 I'm going to show you the constraint diameter and we're constrained that to 17mm. [0:10:03]
 We can see that the sketch has gone green, bright green so it's for the constraint. [0:10:10]
 Now come and over to the model and click on the image plane. [0:10:13]
 I can see that we've got ticks going across here so I'm just going to go edit refresh to [0:10:19]
 refresh those. [0:10:20]
 Then come down to the data tab and we're going to look at the position in the placement. [0:10:26]
 I'm going to start moving this into position. [0:10:29]
 So we're looking for a near enough fit so best fit because we know this dimension and [0:10:37]
 we'll be going off the other circles in here and closely fit them to our model. [0:10:42]
 I'm going to say that we're centered now and I'm going to come back over to the task. [0:10:47]
 And we're going to start sketching in some other elements. [0:10:51]
 So I'm looking at round and looking at the other elements and looking at these circles. [0:10:55]
 So these are plain circles. [0:10:56]
 We're going to hit a little bit of an issue with this because we need to fully constrain [0:11:00]
 the sketch. [0:11:01]
 So that's how to circle. [0:11:04]
 Click on the circle. [0:11:06]
 Come down, click around about the middle and bring the circle out. [0:11:10]
 We can zoom in to start to position this. [0:11:13]
 Hit a scape or press mouse right button to get the point back and start when it's [0:11:18]
 relating this into position. [0:11:22]
 Once it's in position, click the circle and we'll add a constraint and I'm going to go [0:11:28]
 for a diameter constraint again. [0:11:33]
 10.14, I'm going to drop this to 10 millimeters and that is in there. [0:11:38]
 But it's not fully constrained. [0:11:40]
 You can see that because it's in white and our sketch has gone from bright green to more [0:11:47]
 transparent green. [0:11:48]
 So we need to sort the constraints out. [0:11:51]
 We could use this point and this point and use high and length constraints in there. [0:11:57]
 But we're going to have to do that for all the other circles. [0:12:02]
 So I'm going to constrain this via so-and-call construction geometry. [0:12:07]
 Now construction geometry allows you to add, say, a line and I'm going to connect up this [0:12:13]
 line to the center point, going to constrain and the center point of this arc like so. [0:12:20]
 And then it allows you to say if I'm looking at these, then I can constrain with an angle [0:12:28]
 between here so these are evenly spaced. [0:12:32]
 So we will have a 360 degree angle divided by 3 which is 120 and we can use this one and [0:12:40]
 say another line here, connect it up to a circle. [0:12:45]
 So that's going to ask our circle in. [0:12:48]
 So that's center point. [0:12:52]
 Like that and we'll create a line that connects up, [0:12:57]
 twisting to that center and twisting to the center here. [0:13:04]
 Now what we can do is take this line and this line and place an angle between them. [0:13:10]
 So using the angle constraint angle and typing 120. [0:13:18]
 If we don't want to do the maths, what we can do is 360, then use the slash for divide and [0:13:25]
 free and that will give us the 120 there. [0:13:28]
 And we'll just manipulate these into position and you can see we can place these like so. [0:13:35]
 Another thing that I'm going to do is take these two lines and make them of equal length [0:13:41]
 using the quality constraint. [0:13:42]
 So let's do this to hit the E course. [0:13:44]
 That means we can come in and out using this point and we'll move them in and out and [0:13:51]
 side to side. [0:13:52]
 So we can get those into position. [0:13:54]
 You may not be able to match these as exactly to your sketch because we may have pictures [0:14:01]
 like that slight angle so the perspective is not quite right. [0:14:05]
 Just going to take these two, these circles. [0:14:09]
 Take the one that's got the constraint first and then this one and hit the quality across [0:14:14]
 those. [0:14:15]
 So this one is equal to here so that's the lock down now. [0:14:18]
 Now just going to get one of them into position. [0:14:22]
 Let's do the other one at the top. [0:14:25]
 So use a circle and I'm not going to place it upon this line. [0:14:28]
 I'm going to place it by the side and I'm not going to make sure I don't touch that line. [0:14:31]
 Otherwise I'll get an order constraint. [0:14:33]
 You can see that order constraint which is a tangent constraint which is just wanting [0:14:37]
 to create the circle. [0:14:39]
 And I've hit the scale which is not good. [0:14:43]
 I've got to double click the sketch and come in again. [0:14:46]
 Hit the scale and you haven't got anything selected and you've still got your mouse pointer [0:14:51]
 available rather than a constraint pointer then it's going to exit the sketch. [0:14:58]
 So now I've got that circle on just going to add a line between this point and connect [0:15:02]
 up to that point and hit the right mouse button and we need an angle constraint between [0:15:13]
 this line and this line. [0:15:17]
 Same using the angle of 120 and that's make this line and this line equal as well. [0:15:28]
 So we've got a quality across there. [0:15:30]
 I'll take this and turn it you can see they're turning now and going in and out so we can [0:15:35]
 place those in the correct position. [0:15:37]
 I'm going to put some height along this line. [0:15:43]
 First of all I'm going to add a vertical constraint. [0:15:46]
 It's a nice and vertical. [0:15:48]
 I could attach it to this vertical axis but it's going to place a vertical constraint in [0:15:52]
 that and we're just getting these into position. [0:15:59]
 So and that will do me. [0:16:02]
 I can see that I've got a slight skew on my reference image which is fine. [0:16:07]
 So now I can place some length in here. [0:16:12]
 With this one we'll just use the vertical distance. [0:16:15]
 We can't use vertical distance if we're letting take this one. [0:16:19]
 We would have to use the distance constraint. [0:16:23]
 This one here constraint and distance. [0:16:25]
 I'm just going to use the vertical distance for this one and we've got 54.62 so I'm going [0:16:32]
 to go 54.5 in there. [0:16:35]
 So we've got how constraint in there. [0:16:38]
 Let's move that across. [0:16:40]
 That out of the way. [0:16:42]
 Everything inside has gone green. [0:16:48]
 If I hide that image plane we can see we've got everything inside of our own green. [0:16:53]
 This one is going to be strange there. [0:16:56]
 I thought it was a bit cloudy. [0:16:58]
 A cloudy green so we need to constrain this one so this needs to be the quality between [0:17:01]
 these two. [0:17:02]
 Make sure that we don't have two things to let it go. [0:17:05]
 And left hand side. [0:17:06]
 So this one, this one. [0:17:09]
 This should turn bright green on now. [0:17:11]
 It calls the everything is constraint. [0:17:15]
 If I come to the task and it closed then this is not a valid sketch at the moment. [0:17:22]
 We don't want these lines. [0:17:23]
 These are construction geometry. [0:17:25]
 So to change those to construction geometry we can click on this line, this line and this [0:17:32]
 line and use the toggle construction geometry. [0:17:37]
 Also available on sketch, sketch geometries and toggle construction geometry. [0:17:45]
 That's gone blue now. [0:17:47]
 It's a lighter blue because it's constrained. [0:17:50]
 If I close that you see those have gone. [0:17:55]
 So construction geometry is basically just a skeleton. [0:17:59]
 If I had nothing selected and selected this icon here you'll see these turn blue. [0:18:05]
 So if you see that we have to do is select the icon again and I'll turn back to normal construction. [0:18:10]
 So this toggle, this toolbar, two from construction mode or toggle's selected constraint, [0:18:16]
 two construction mode. [0:18:18]
 That's bring back our reference image. [0:18:20]
 For instance, based on that. [0:18:22]
 We're now going to add the arcs. [0:18:24]
 So I'm going to come into one of the sketches, one of the size that is most accurate. [0:18:30]
 And go for the top and we're going to add an arc. [0:18:35]
 So using the arc here we've got an input and a input and a input on using the center and [0:18:40]
 an input. [0:18:41]
 And we place the mouse pointer, coincident to this point. [0:18:45]
 So we've got the coincident string click and we'll get a circle. [0:18:49]
 This is an arc but we get a line. [0:18:51]
 So this is where the arc actually starts. [0:18:54]
 So I'm going to start it here. [0:18:55]
 We can line up the circle with that edge to see where we will be able to start. [0:19:02]
 So I can see this arc starts vanishing into the reference image here. [0:19:06]
 So our arc is going to be about here to here. [0:19:13]
 I'm going to make this arc using this point and this point and using this line. [0:19:19]
 And the reference so click that last. [0:19:22]
 Make that symmetrical to there. [0:19:26]
 It's over constrained so we've got a problem there. [0:19:30]
 So if we do mount and use the task, you can see we've got redundant constraint number [0:19:37]
 15. [0:19:38]
 If I click that, you'll highlight it in green. [0:19:41]
 So we can see we've got this vertical constraint which we've been using symmetry. [0:19:45]
 We don't need that. [0:19:47]
 So we can hit delete. [0:19:49]
 So we've already highlighted and we've got that in there. [0:19:54]
 So that's symmetrical to that point. [0:19:57]
 I can click on this arc and use a radius constraint. [0:20:04]
 So drop this down and constrain the radius. [0:20:06]
 And we'll say about 11 millimeters there. [0:20:09]
 Now I've got the arc we can start putting in some line geometry. [0:20:14]
 So click the line and I'm going to follow this edge. [0:20:17]
 To click on that and follow this edge down like so. [0:20:22]
 Hit escape and I want this tangent to this arc because at the moment if I leave this we can [0:20:29]
 see the wall. [0:20:30]
 It's not tangent. [0:20:31]
 We need fluid arc connection to this. [0:20:34]
 So click this line and this arc. [0:20:37]
 Look out to the left and we've got void redundant order constraints. [0:20:41]
 So this will come in handy when we're creating geometry that requires removal of all [0:20:48]
 constraints. [0:20:49]
 So I'm going to use a constraint tangent. [0:20:52]
 We get this sketch of constraint substitution which is okay. [0:20:56]
 So now this point which was coincidence has been substituted with a tangent constraint. [0:21:03]
 And we've got our line in place. [0:21:05]
 It comes all the way down on to about here. [0:21:11]
 Now this looks like an arc but what we're going to do is basically do the same what we did [0:21:16]
 here over here. [0:21:18]
 Just sketch that in there using the arc again using this point. [0:21:23]
 And we'll come out and just place this arc in quickly. [0:21:26]
 So we can show you how to actually manipulate that without having problems. [0:21:35]
 Now how do I make this symmetrical to say this line here? [0:21:44]
 So on these points so there's not symmetrical we want it about over here. [0:21:47]
 We can do that by clicking in both these points and then clicking the constraint geometry [0:21:56]
 and using symmetric. [0:21:58]
 Symmetric constraint there. [0:22:00]
 That symmetric crossed there. [0:22:01]
 So we've really done that on the top one that we used. [0:22:05]
 I'll basically see this vertical line which doesn't matter. [0:22:09]
 It still works. [0:22:11]
 Now we can manipulate that into position and don't worry if it's not good fit. [0:22:17]
 It's close enough that we can just carry on and finish our model. [0:22:24]
 Next thing again is the mine going out over here. [0:22:29]
 And we'll make this arc and this line. [0:22:34]
 Quick both of them make them tangent to each other. [0:22:38]
 Get the substitution gain. [0:22:39]
 Okay that. [0:22:40]
 Now I want to take the radius because I've got radius in here somewhere where there's [0:22:45]
 here there's the radius there. [0:22:48]
 So I want to take this arc and this arc and use an equality. [0:22:55]
 So those radiuses are the same. [0:23:00]
 Also want to take this line and this line and make those equal. [0:23:08]
 So we're beginning to build up our shape. [0:23:16]
 Question is is there an arc between these and I think there is a slight arc there. [0:23:23]
 So that's add an arc and this time I'm going to use the end point and [0:23:27]
 ROOM point arc so I'm going to click this point and this point and just add a small arc there. [0:23:36]
 It's great to get the mouse point back or you're right mouse button and select the arc and [0:23:41]
 one of the edges and use the tangent C. [0:23:45]
 Okay that's tangent and then do the same over here this one and this one and tangent. [0:23:52]
 Okay so now we've got a nice move line between those. [0:23:57]
 Now we've got the equality so we can move that into place so I can move it about there. [0:24:05]
 And that's looking nice so I'm going to use this arc and come over and use a radius [0:24:17]
 and that's around that up to 80 so we've got a radius constraint across there. [0:24:22]
 So we've done creating number of arcs and radiuses across those. [0:24:31]
 Now as I said we could just do this side and create mirrors or polar patterns or so across [0:24:41]
 here but we're doing it all in the sketch. [0:24:43]
 That's repeat this process all the way around so let's quickly do that and I'm just going to [0:24:49]
 lay down an arc there and align that connects like this point and this point [0:24:56]
 I do this quickly and this point and we have now that our arc in here so I'm going to drop that [0:25:03]
 on there and we'll create another line here comes out here and place an arc in there this point [0:25:12]
 and this point and create a little arc there and we need a line as well so just quickly [0:25:20]
 done those around there and we'll add our arc in here so come up to this and drop it down [0:25:29]
 to the center and point arc and this is coming over and hover over that center point [0:25:35]
 come out and what we're going to do is this time hover over this point connect up [0:25:44]
 bring this right the way around and hover over this point and we've got quizzic constraint and [0:25:50]
 connect up those are already connected so it's a suburb time let's bring this down but you can see [0:25:59]
 it's a bit hot over the place at the moment so we're missing our tangency so this arc [0:26:05]
 this line tangent see how that's straightened up there so it's nice and fluid arc and we'll do the [0:26:15]
 same over this side and create our tangency and okay that we've got symmetry across here so we can [0:26:24]
 take these two points and then the last point or line that we use is symmetrical across there so [0:26:33]
 this line here our construction geometry and use the symmetry constraint so that's all in symmetry [0:26:41]
 let's make sure that we've got tangency across these two tangency okay and same for this one [0:26:52]
 tangency okay and same for these two tangency [0:27:02]
 and these two and finally these two right we've got all right we've got over constraint [0:27:21]
 so we have an issue here same redundant constraint is 39 so if we click 39 we can see what a [0:27:31]
 tangency constraint up here which is redundant that one there that's deletes that and that's because [0:27:40]
 we had two tangency constraints so that's gone now that's all good and we need to make [0:27:51]
 all we've got these arcs going all the way around here so we need to also make [0:27:57]
 this arc equals well so we can take an arc and this arc and use the equality [0:28:06]
 these two lines in fact all of these lines here and these two [0:28:18]
 need equality as well but redundant constraint there because we've already added it somewhere so we [0:28:27]
 just click on that hit delete that neatens up our constraints so if we add more multiple constraints [0:28:33]
 and then we add to the magaine it just clears them up for us and these three arcs also need [0:28:43]
 equality across them so we've almost finished our sketch but it's not fully constrained [0:28:48]
 let's have a look at what it looks like it closed well it's getting there so we're getting our [0:28:55]
 sketching down our tracing down let's come back into the sketch and that's start adding [0:29:05]
 because we've done basically a few that in constraints here we have radius [0:29:12]
 we have a radius somewhere else where's the radius there we've got a radius there as well [0:29:18]
 which was this one so you can see a pointing to that and this one here we can see that [0:29:30]
 we have you can see the arrow there so we're bringing this down and you can see a little arrow in here [0:29:40]
 so we're highlight that and see that little arrow in the little yellow arrow here [0:29:45]
 that shows you what arc it's using so that one there so what we need to do is [0:29:54]
 create length of distance in this one and that will constrain everything because we've got [0:30:05]
 equality across these lines and this is the only one that's not constrained because we've got [0:30:11]
 our radius constraint here we've got our radius constraint in here we've said that all these arcs are equal [0:30:19]
 and we've got a radius constraint down here was this one connected to so that's connected so you can [0:30:28]
 see the arrows connected to that arc there on there everything's constrained except for these lines [0:30:36]
 but they have an equality constraint all the way across them so the minute we add a constraint [0:30:42]
 to one of these lines it's the only one that's left so distance across there because we can't use a [0:30:49]
 height or length and we'll just okay that we're fully constrained it's closed out that now [0:30:56]
 and we sketched our first part let's just click on the image press spacebar [0:31:03]
 and there it is we've only got a sketch so we can use that in the part design or the part [0:31:12]
 that's useless say in the part design okay so the part design and we'll create a body [0:31:21]
 okay so the model we can see the body has been added but the sketch is an insider so if I clicked [0:31:27]
 on the sketch and tried to pad this then it cannot use the sketch because it's not inside the body [0:31:33]
 so what we have to do is take that sketch and drop it inside the body simple as that now [0:31:40]
 or we use the pad we get a pad so we've come far for our journey so far we've learnt how to [0:31:46]
 use the part design the sketcher and now the image workbench we're going to continue in our next [0:31:54]
 video sketching and tracing with the image workbench but this time on multiple planes so we're going [0:32:00]
 to be looking at creating an object that we need multiple reference images for through this [0:32:05]
 will learn much more about sketching and part design before moving away into our [0:32:10]
