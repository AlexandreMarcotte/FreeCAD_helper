===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD For Beginners - 35 (Part 5) - CAD Thinking Part 5- Latch Assembly =====
 In previous videos we learnt how to model each of the parts of this assembly to get [0:00:04]
 understand in how you would convert something that's actually physical into a digital form. [0:00:10]
 And how the different profile choices will affect the number of actions you have to make in [0:00:14]
 free CAD or any CAD package to create your model. [0:00:18]
 Hopefully by now you've got an understanding of how you tackle something like this. [0:00:22]
 And the consequences from a different choice of profile and the challenges that you would [0:00:26]
 face along the way. [0:00:28]
 This video should be quite short and it just finishes off taking all those parts, [0:00:32]
 putting it into the A2 Plus Worldbench, constraining them together with the simulation of [0:00:38]
 the part work it. [0:00:39]
 So I hope you enjoyed these videos and let's finish this project. [0:00:42]

 So I'm going to start assembly in FreeCAD in the A2 Plus Worldbench. [0:01:12]
 There are a number of assembly workpages in FreeCAD and they're installed from the tools [0:01:16]
 and add-on manager. [0:01:19]
 Within here you'll find A2 Plus assembly 4, explode assembly, etc. [0:01:23]
 There are a number of them there and they all do something different. [0:01:26]
 Some of them can even work together such as the explode assembly. [0:01:31]
 We're going to be using the A2 Plus. [0:01:33]
 Now the A2 Plus requires the parts to be imported in from the separate files. [0:01:38]
 We're going to create a new document and also we need to save it. [0:01:43]
 So we can save straight away. [0:01:45]
 So save as. [0:01:46]
 It's best to keep your latch assembly and your parts in the same directory. [0:01:52]
 And that way we keep everything together. [0:01:54]
 So if we move the directory everything moves with it. [0:01:58]
 I'm just going to call the file latch assembly. [0:02:04]
 Now we've saved the file, we can import the parts. [0:02:07]
 There are two ways of importing parts. [0:02:09]
 One way is to add a part from a external file. [0:02:12]
 And the other one is to add a shape from a external file. [0:02:15]
 They do do something different. [0:02:18]
 So we click add a shape from a external file and go for part 1 and open that up. [0:02:25]
 It will pull that part straight in. [0:02:28]
 Let's just leave that and go for the add shape from external file. [0:02:36]
 And we'll go for part 1 again. [0:02:38]
 You'll notice that it will ask you to import the objects. [0:02:41]
 So these are the visible objects within your imported file. [0:02:45]
 Let's just click the ones we want to import. [0:02:49]
 And click import. [0:02:51]
 And those we've imported this part. [0:02:53]
 There is going to be something that we need to change with it. [0:02:56]
 And if we come to over to the part body, we'll see this fixed position. [0:03:04]
 There has to be one or more fixed positions in assembly. [0:03:09]
 The reason why it's fixed is because when we simulate this, this part will stay stationary. [0:03:15]
 It's best to import the fixed position part first, not like we've done here. [0:03:22]
 I'm going to transform this by using right click transform. [0:03:28]
 And rotate this around this way. [0:03:33]
 Let's move over to the left and hit OK. [0:03:40]
 That's import our fixed part. [0:03:42]
 I'm going to use the add shape from external file. [0:03:46]
 Our fixed part is part 3, the base of our object. [0:03:51]
 You can see straight away we've got the sketch that's come up. [0:03:55]
 That's fitable. [0:03:57]
 And we've got the body here. [0:03:58]
 So I'm going to click on the body and import that one. [0:04:03]
 We've imported the body. [0:04:06]
 And if we look to the left, we can see part 3. [0:04:11]
 And I'm going to set the fixed position as true. [0:04:14]
 Which you can see there, it's same true. [0:04:19]
 This part is just floating about at the moment. [0:04:21]
 It's still got a fixed position. [0:04:24]
 Let's right click and transform this out the way. [0:04:30]
 So now that's import another part. [0:04:35]
 I'm going to go for part 2 and open that up. [0:04:40]
 Import the body and hit import. [0:04:43]
 This has become mobile. [0:04:45]
 I'm going to just drop it onto the screen. [0:04:50]
 And we'll start constrain in this to this part here. [0:04:54]
 For that, I need to find out the connection points. [0:04:57]
 So I'm going to connect up between this hole and this hole. [0:05:01]
 Normally we would have some kind of connector in here like a pin. [0:05:04]
 I can go model that. [0:05:06]
 But we're just going to progress through this assembly. [0:05:11]
 To attach the parts, I need to pick the circle on the other side. [0:05:17]
 And the circle of where I'm going to connect. [0:05:23]
 Look to our constraints on the toolbar. [0:05:25]
 We've got add circular edge constraint. [0:05:27]
 If I click that, the part will be moved into position. [0:05:32]
 Then we get this dialog box that comes up. [0:05:36]
 If we look at this, we might need to add some offset to this. [0:05:40]
 So you can see that it's touching this part. [0:05:44]
 And we can set an offset from here. [0:05:48]
 So I'm going to go minus 0.5. [0:05:55]
 Now that's in position. [0:05:57]
 That's hit a set. [0:05:59]
 And we can move on to the next part. [0:06:01]
 So we're going to import another part now. [0:06:04]
 If we get an error when this moves, that's because it may be fixed. [0:06:10]
 We look to the left. [0:06:11]
 We can see that the tree is being filled with our parts. [0:06:15]
 That's open up. [0:06:18]
 Part 3 and part 2. [0:06:19]
 And you can see the circular constraints have been added. [0:06:22]
 If I press the spacebar to hide them, you'll see the corresponding constraint is hidden [0:06:29]
 as well. [0:06:30]
 Let's press this spacebar again. [0:06:34]
 That's import our last part. [0:06:37]
 Add shape from the external part. [0:06:40]
 This is part 4. [0:06:42]
 And open. [0:06:43]
 Select the body. [0:06:45]
 And import. [0:06:47]
 It has become mobile. [0:06:48]
 So I'm going to place it where everyone at any time we can right click and transform. [0:06:53]
 Now our part has been placed into the screen. [0:06:56]
 Let's take this circle. [0:07:00]
 And this circle. [0:07:04]
 And again, use a circle on circle constraint. [0:07:10]
 If we look, we can see what's happened. [0:07:16]
 We may need some offset. [0:07:17]
 If we accept that at any time, we can come back in to the constraint. [0:07:22]
 And change where that's going to sit. [0:07:25]
 Again, I'm going to go minus 0.5 millimeters. [0:07:29]
 I send it the other way and it's in position. [0:07:34]
 We also got the option to flip direction. [0:07:37]
 We'll set the direction mode from here. [0:07:41]
 Let's accept that. [0:07:44]
 And now let's bring in our other part. [0:07:47]
 So we need to constrain this part against here. [0:07:52]
 At the moment, this is fixed. [0:07:55]
 So we must check that it's fixed. [0:07:56]
 Fix position true. [0:07:59]
 And these will be fixed position or false. [0:08:04]
 If I click on the similar button, we'll see this starts to move. [0:08:11]
 So we've got the constraints working in here. [0:08:14]
 Let's click off and drop those there. [0:08:17]
 So we need to position this. [0:08:20]
 Again, I'm going to come in and use this circle. [0:08:24]
 And this time, I'm going to constrain it to this bar here. [0:08:29]
 So control slit both of those. [0:08:32]
 So you can see that the constraint that we use previously has been grayed out. [0:08:36]
 Next to it, we've got an access constraint. [0:08:38]
 And these align the accesses of those two parts. [0:08:43]
 For click it, we can see the constraint inconsistent cannot solve. [0:08:48]
 That's okay that. [0:08:49]
 And delete that constraint and hit yes. [0:08:53]
 Look over to the left. [0:08:55]
 You see we've got the access constraint here. [0:08:57]
 We need to delete that. [0:08:59]
 We look to the part four. [0:09:00]
 We can see the fixed position is false. [0:09:03]
 And this one, the fixed position is true. [0:09:07]
 This is the reason why it wouldn't constrain. [0:09:11]
 So let's drop this down and set it to false. [0:09:14]
 Now the fixed position of this part is false. [0:09:17]
 I can select the circle again and this bar. [0:09:21]
 And use the access constraint. [0:09:25]
 It now moves into position and will accept that. [0:09:30]
 Notice how it's been placed. [0:09:34]
 If I select the moves that set to part under constraint, [0:09:38]
 we can see how that's going to move. [0:09:40]
 We can actually move it up and down that access. [0:09:45]
 It's what we want, but we also need to keep this in line with this part here. [0:09:52]
 Now this is where our multiple constraints come in handy. [0:09:55]
 Come to the base. [0:09:58]
 We can see we have got edges, vertices and planes that we can constrain too. [0:10:07]
 If we look at the model, we can see we can keep lines in line with each other [0:10:13]
 so we can take this line and this line. [0:10:16]
 I use the access constraint so we can keep these two in line. [0:10:20]
 Let's click on that. [0:10:21]
 And you can see the constraint has been accepted. [0:10:24]
 To set that. [0:10:27]
 Now if we look, we can see what's happened. [0:10:32]
 Let's try simulating this. [0:10:37]
 Move object under constraint. [0:10:39]
 And we can start to move this object back and forth. [0:10:44]
 And now this keeps in line on this plane. [0:10:51]
 If you have problems trying to get these constraints to work, [0:10:56]
 just make sure you haven't got any left over constraints on the left hand side here. [0:11:01]
 Remember when we add a constraint and it fails, [0:11:03]
 we may have to remove it from the left hand side in our tree view as well. [0:11:09]
 So we've come to the end of editorial. [0:11:12]
 We've learnt how to use the A2 plus workbench. [0:11:15]
 We've learnt how to model each of those individual parts. [0:11:18]
 I learnt about the different choices between profiles [0:11:22]
 and how they affect our operations. [0:11:25]
 We've also covered how to create more stable models. [0:11:28]
 And the reasons why you add operations such as chamfers, [0:11:31]
 fillets, etc. [0:11:32]
 as the last operation. [0:11:34]
 This set of videos is really a standard alone set of videos. [0:11:38]
 That complements the learning free capital beginner series. [0:11:41]
 And on low it's part of that series. [0:11:43]
 This can be used separately as one single piece of learning material. [0:11:47]
 Please look out my co-fice site because I will be selling this set as one collection. [0:11:52]
 This means it will be free of ads and you can consume it at your own leisure. [0:11:56]
 Thanks a lot for watching and I'll see you again soon. [0:11:58]
