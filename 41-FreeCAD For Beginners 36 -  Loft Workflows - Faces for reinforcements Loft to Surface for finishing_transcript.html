===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners 36 -  Loft Workflows - Faces for reinforcements Loft to Surface for finishing =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to the channel and today in the learning freak out for [0:00:03]
 beginner series we're going to be looking at two lofting workflows. [0:00:07]
 So we're going to be looking at part design and a part lofting workflow. [0:00:12]
 The first one is in the part design and we're going to be creating reinforcement via a loft. [0:00:17]
 So these parts here are reinforcing this object. So if we had a hole, [0:00:23]
 let's say we've a wheel in here, these will be our reinforcement. [0:00:26]
 In our other workflow, this one here which is a part workflow, we're lofting to a surface. [0:00:33]
 So we can know we can loft to a point or loft to a profile. We're actually using a surface in [0:00:41]
 our lofting workflow and this is good for when you have a loft but the end surface isn't [0:00:47]
 a flat profile and you want more control of the end of the loft using regular surface [0:00:52]
 in techniques within the surface workbench. So I hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a [0:00:56]
 look at these techniques. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a [0:01:01]

 So for this first workflow we're going to be using the part design. [0:01:26]
 Crane new body, I'm going to create a new sketch upon the xy plane so looking down on the object. [0:01:33]
 We're going to create a very simple structure using the m point and rin point arc. [0:01:39]
 Coming to here, we're not going to touch this line otherwise we're going to get a tangent seal [0:01:46]
 so I'm going to make sure I'm well away from it. You're going to hit a skate to go [0:01:50]
 the mouse point back and add some lines. So just coming up here adds some lines this way. [0:01:55]
 Hit a skate and take this arc and this line and just make the tangent. [0:02:02]
 Okay and the same with this one. [0:02:07]
 It's got tangent here across there and we've got endpoint tangent here applied. [0:02:12]
 We're just close the sketch with a straight line going across here. [0:02:17]
 Hit a skate and take this point and this point and make the end quintent. [0:02:23]
 So we have this structure. [0:02:27]
 We're going to add these two points and this line was symmetry and pull this out. [0:02:38]
 So we have this structure and I'm going to hit close and I'm going to pat this by about 20 millimeters. [0:02:45]
 We've already got it selected. It's a padded by about 20 millimeters and then we're going to [0:02:51]
 sketch upon this face. So I'm going to let this face and I'm going to create a sketch. [0:02:56]
 The reason why I'm selecting the face and creating the sketch on there is because I'm going [0:03:01]
 to show you something regarding a problem that may happen when you go and add this feature. [0:03:07]
 So again I'm going to make a very similar sketch coming out. [0:03:13]
 I could use the poly line to save myself a bit of time which I should have done but that's okay. [0:03:18]
 And make those quintent and take these two. [0:03:26]
 We need tangent C. [0:03:27]
 Okay that and these two with tangent C as well. [0:03:31]
 You can uncheck this if you want. So you can get in those messages come up. [0:03:38]
 So we have this now and finally these two points and this line we have symmetry. [0:03:45]
 Close that. This sketch has the support of this face pad face six and flat face on there. [0:03:55]
 That's pad that and we're pad this by 15 millimeters. [0:04:00]
 Now what I want to do is I'm going to have a hole in here and I'm going to fit say a [0:04:08]
 willon here. Let's say this was part of the base of the chair where we'll sit in here. So we need [0:04:13]
 some supporting geometry to hold this. So some supporting material to go in here. [0:04:18]
 To do that I'm going to make a loft between this face and this face. [0:04:25]
 But I can't do this at the moment because these are a bit too big. I want something a bit smaller in here. [0:04:33]
 To make the loft as we are just click on that face and use the additive loft and you can see that face has been added. [0:04:42]
 So we can loft faces, add section and then click on the other face. That lofts [0:04:48]
 or queen those two. Like so if we hit OK we can see we've got this support now [0:04:53]
 that will strengthen this part of the object. But I want this smaller [0:05:00]
 to do that and just delete that loft and bring back the pad. [0:05:05]
 This one here and I'm going to go in to the base pad so I'm going to come back to the very first [0:05:15]
 pad we did and come into the sketch. Now I'm going to add some geometry in here that's going to break [0:05:23]
 my operations below this pad. So I'm going to split this edge using the split tool which is this one [0:05:34]
 here split edge. Sketch, sketch geometry and split edge. So we're going to split this edge [0:05:43]
 just by clicking on this arc and we can make some symmetry across these two with the vertical axis [0:05:51]
 to make that symmetrical and hit close. Now if we look on the left hand side we can see a problem. [0:06:00]
 This sketch has now got an exclamation mark on it and it says no plan of face in a touch engine. [0:06:08]
 So it's given us an unusual error. The reason is is because we've changed the underlying geometry [0:06:14]
 so we added more edges and if we look this says pad face six. Remember this pad is still visible. [0:06:24]
 So what's this pad this face here? If we hover over it we can see that's pad face eight. [0:06:30]
 So our faces become renamed because we've added more faces on here. This is really easy to solve. [0:06:38]
 All we have to do is come to the sketch. We're the supporters. We just click on it [0:06:44]
 and just clear that support and hit OK. We'll be click off. We'll be able to recalculate [0:06:52]
 and our sketch is now fine. We can remap that sketch if we want. [0:06:58]
 But our pad is fine now. We've got no errors. We can leave it as it is or we can remap it. [0:07:05]
 So that's bringing about the original pad and click on this sketch which I'm going to remap. [0:07:13]
 Click the map mode and select this face and hit OK. Click off. [0:07:22]
 It's got tick by the sketch saying it needs to recompute in. [0:07:27]
 And it refresh and everything's OK. So bring about the pad and we can see that's sitting there. [0:07:37]
 I'm going to create another split like this one on this side. We could use this if we want to just [0:07:43]
 to loft between these two faces. I'm going to do the same on this side. We've got no [0:07:48]
 portions in front of it so we're going to be OK. And let's do a quick look at that and add the split. [0:07:53]
 And we just split these two and take this point. This point and the vertical [0:08:01]
 access and just use symmetry across those. Hit close. We now got these two faces. [0:08:08]
 The sketch is still visible so we can click on that for us at space bar of 1 2. [0:08:12]
 And we can add the loft. To do that, again, click on the face. [0:08:19]
 Additive loft. The face has been added and then we just add a section and click on the other face. [0:08:28]
 And we can see we've lofted it between those and hit OK. [0:08:33]
 So we created that feature there. We could even delete that as you've loft. [0:08:40]
 Click on the pad, bring it back. But present space bar and say add [0:08:48]
 loft between these two and these two. So click on that face. [0:08:55]
 Click the loft and section. That's left between those two. Hit OK. [0:09:05]
 And we can do the same on the other side. Click one loft and section and click on the other face. [0:09:13]
 And OK. So we created that loft between there and we've got a nice sturdy support [0:09:19]
 if we're going to add a hole here for say a will or something. For our next loft workflow, [0:09:26]
 we're going to be using the part workbench. The reason why we're using the part workbench [0:09:31]
 is because it's very versatile and very flexible with the different profiles that you can use [0:09:36]
 with your lofting. For instance, rather than just using sketches and faces, we can use surfaces, [0:09:43]
 vertices, edges, etc. in there. We're going to be using a loft to a surface workflow. [0:09:49]
 And this comes in handy if we want to close loft, but we don't want to close loft to a point. [0:09:55]
 We actually want to surface the closure so it's a feature in itself. I'm going to come over to [0:10:00]
 the sketcher and first create the closing surface. I'm going to do something simple. So I'm going [0:10:08]
 to go along the xy plane and I'm going to use a slot geometry in here. Just a basic slot geometry. [0:10:15]
 And we're going to constrain this down as well. It doesn't matter what constraints you put in here, [0:10:27]
 just going to constrain it down and make this so much called to the center. [0:10:34]
 So this is a profile in itself, but we're going to use this in the surface workbench. I need to [0:10:43]
 add some kind of surface on top of here. Now I'm just going to go for an oval dome surface. [0:10:47]
 Before I do that, let's make the profiles for the loft. I'm just going to duplicate that up the sketch. [0:10:55]
 Using duke section, a couple of times. And we're going to transform them using the placement [0:11:07]
 position along the z axis. And we're going to go minus 10. And this one's going to be minus 20. [0:11:17]
 That's a men's some of these profiles to allow for the loft. So for instance, this one, [0:11:28]
 we're just going to set the length of 100 millimeters and a radius of 30 millimeters. [0:11:37]
 Close up and let the next one. This one here. [0:11:44]
 Radius 25 and a length of 90. And close up. So we have some profiles to loft against. [0:11:59]
 I'm going to hide these profiles these two here. Press in the space box. [0:12:07]
 And this is going to be my top profile. So this one is going to be my surface profile. [0:12:13]
 Now I need to think about what my surface is going to look like. [0:12:20]
 We're going to be using the surface workbench to create that. And this is going to be our base shape. [0:12:27]
 And then we're going to deform the surface upwards in an arc. For that, we need to [0:12:31]
 support in geometry. And this will support the surface as a constraint. So the first one I'm going [0:12:36]
 to do is create some cross pieces. So some cross arcs here using these points as the attachment. [0:12:43]
 Now we went through the attachment mode. I'll explain those zx, the setter in a previous video. [0:12:49]
 And I'm going to use those for this one. But I'm going to talk you through them. So if you haven't [0:12:53]
 seen that video, then we can still do those. Let's come around to left hand side. [0:12:58]
 Now we're going to zoom in. And I'm going to attach to these points here. We can select both [0:13:06]
 these points. You hold it down the control key. So I'm selected both of those. And we can create [0:13:13]
 a new sketch and select the right attachment. So O is the origin of your new sketch. So we've got two [0:13:20]
 reference points. O is the origin, which we will attach to the first one we selected. So the first [0:13:26]
 reference point. The second one we selected, which is over here, will be the second point. So these are [0:13:31]
 the axis as the sketch. So the origin is going to be attached to point one. And the next one, [0:13:37]
 the x or the y or the z, is going to be attached to point two. So I'm going to go O x y. And here [0:13:47]
 I'm going to attach to point two. And you can see how that's placed me. It's attached to me [0:13:52]
 from this point to this point. But we are around the wrong way. We're actually looking down on this [0:13:57]
 where we need to be on the side. We can change that by changing the rotation. [0:14:02]
 So you can see the origin is here. My x of the sketch runs this way and the y runs this way. [0:14:11]
 It's a bit of a advance attachment mode, but it's very powerful. So I can add my sketch in here. [0:14:18]
 The curve and we're pulling this point here. [0:14:24]
 It's escape and use a quintant constraint across those. And then we can rotate this [0:14:32]
 over by selecting the sketch coming down to the data. It's now attached so we look at the attachment, [0:14:39]
 going to the attachment, going to the angle. And we need to change the axis as well. So I'm going [0:14:50]
 to put 90 degrees on this angle. We can see what's happened. It's gone around this way. [0:14:53]
 When I click off the constraint we'll kick in. So remember it's constrained to this point here. [0:15:01]
 That's changed the axis. I'll come into the axis. At the moment it's around the z. So zero that [0:15:07]
 and place a one in the x and click off. And now that's in the right position. [0:15:14]
 Every name that to profile. So profile one. I'm going to take this profile and duplicate it. [0:15:26]
 Uncheck the surface profile because we don't want that. We just want one profile and here. Okay. [0:15:34]
 Now we've got the profile two. It's in the same position. So I'm going to come into this vertex here [0:15:44]
 and delete the contents. So we can delete that and delete the other one. So now we're back to the [0:15:54]
 start. Click reference one. Select the other vertex. Click reference two. And select the other vertex. [0:16:05]
 Which is behind this one. So really if we look at this we don't actually need to select that. [0:16:16]
 Because translate origin was enough. I say okay. [0:16:20]
 So we've got those two in there. Now we can add another arc that goes this way. [0:16:29]
 So we can troll into surface at three points. So one two and a third that goes this way. [0:16:39]
 Let's come around to the front and add the arc in. So this is going to be on the x z plane. [0:16:46]
 So new sketch along the x z plane. Okay that. I'm going to pull this in geometry. [0:16:53]
 So I'm going to pull in this arc to get this point and this one. And also these arcs as well to get [0:17:01]
 the top points. I can use these to my advantage now. So I'm going to create a couple of arcs. [0:17:10]
 Connect it up. So first one. And our second and our third. [0:17:21]
 Glead constraints on. So when I hover over these we get the old constraint. [0:17:30]
 And make sure that these arcs are tangent as well. So we're using the tangent c. [0:17:35]
 In OK and the tangent c here as well. So a nice and tangent. [0:17:40]
 That means if this arc changes the arc as well as well. [0:17:45]
 For completeness if we wanted to we can pull back the arc of profile. So the one that we made invisible. [0:17:53]
 Let's bring these back. [0:17:55]
 And I'm going to add some construction geometry because we can keep this tangent with these profiles as well. [0:18:02]
 So we get a nice transition. This is dependent on your application. [0:18:07]
 So take a line connect line up to this point. [0:18:11]
 Quince and constraint and place a line. So down here. [0:18:15]
 We next take this line and this arc. I make those tangent. [0:18:21]
 And OK. If I move this line we get the tangency of our surface moving. [0:18:28]
 So I can place this. So on here. And control the rest of our shape. [0:18:35]
 We may need to zoom out a bit. [0:18:40]
 And if we have a problem then we may need to pull in. So this arc. [0:18:48]
 Come in. Make this point and this point. [0:18:53]
 Quince and we get our arc shape here. [0:18:58]
 If we want to we can remove this arc and add more arcs in. [0:19:04]
 And making those tangent. So it's totally up to you. [0:19:17]
 Just give us more control over this surface. [0:19:28]
 Once I'm happy you may want to change this to construction geometry. So it doesn't show up. [0:19:42]
 So this is blue now. Come over to the task and hit close. So we've got this arc in here. [0:19:48]
 But we can now control. [0:19:51]
 Change this. [0:19:54]
 Proof of free. [0:19:57]
 Let's create our surface. [0:20:01]
 Go to the surface web inch and create a fill in surface. [0:20:10]
 Add edge and we want to add the top edges. [0:20:15]
 In sequence. [0:20:20]
 If I'm in this one. [0:20:23]
 And then we add the constraints. So come down to edge constraints. [0:20:29]
 And we start to add the edge constraints. So add edge and I'm going to add this one first. [0:20:37]
 If it finishes we can come underneath and select live from underneath. [0:20:42]
 Like so. And this one. [0:20:47]
 So you can see how that's default up. [0:20:49]
 Gains that arc. And then we add the ever arcs as well. [0:20:54]
 This controls our surface. So we get this nice surface in here. [0:20:59]
 Because it's all attached to these arcs. So there's a crossover point. [0:21:04]
 We get a nice clean surface. [0:21:06]
 If we okay that we can see the evor options that we have to make this even better. [0:21:12]
 So if we look at the surface on the left hand side we can see the options available. [0:21:16]
 To make this a better surface. [0:21:19]
 I first can come out to file and save to save this project. [0:21:23]
 The reason why I've done this is because some of these options. [0:21:31]
 If we push them too far it can hang up the computer. [0:21:34]
 So the first is the degree. [0:21:35]
 If we change the degree this is the starting degree of this surface. [0:21:40]
 So you can see how that's changed there. [0:21:42]
 Loast is too. [0:21:43]
 And we can increase this up and we can see the degrees of the surface changing. [0:21:50]
 Push it too far and we start to get problems. [0:21:56]
 So it's the starting degree of how this surface curves up. [0:22:00]
 Obviously if we got restrictions via constraints that we have on here. [0:22:04]
 Then it's going to affect the degree and how much of the effect that has on your surface. [0:22:09]
 The next one along is the points on curve. [0:22:15]
 So these are the constraints. [0:22:17]
 And we can increase this say 20. [0:22:23]
 And we'll get more points in this edge. [0:22:26]
 If I bring this down to say 2. [0:22:29]
 See how the surface has taken effect there. [0:22:33]
 We've got we've looked from the side and we've got these curves. [0:22:36]
 You can see that we haven't got enough points on these curves going around. [0:22:39]
 Again, watch out for putting this too high because it can hang out your computer. [0:22:44]
 So let's back to 15 and it'll look fine with the 15. [0:22:49]
 This ratio is the algorithm. [0:22:52]
 So this is a approximation algorithm that used for the nerve surface that's placed across there. [0:22:58]
 All the values that you see along here changes the tolerance of that algorithm. [0:23:03]
 There is not much documentation around these values in the freak had a wiki. [0:23:08]
 So it takes a bit of experimentation to get that correct. [0:23:11]
 If I lower the iterations to say 1, [0:23:15]
 you can see that we've got a less defined surface and the number of points have moved away from this curve. [0:23:25]
 So now if we opt the number of points to say 30, [0:23:30]
 you can see they've been placed back on there. [0:23:34]
 I'm going to set this back to 15 and the iterations to 2. [0:23:40]
 To clean this up even further we can go to the view tab so make sure it's selected. [0:23:48]
 It goes to the view tab and we look at the deviation. [0:23:51]
 So this is the accuracy of that polygon and drop this to 0.05. [0:23:57]
 And you can see an instant effect in there and there's cleaned up that surface. [0:24:03]
 Now we can get into the lofting to do that. I'm going to come over to the part where bench [0:24:08]
 and I'm going to use the loft featuring here. [0:24:12]
 This is quite flexible in the part where bench because we can loft between profiles and a surface. [0:24:19]
 So let's click that feature for the loft and we can select our sketches. [0:24:24]
 So we want this sketch here. [0:24:27]
 This is where naming them comes in handy. [0:24:30]
 So sketch 2 we can see it highlighted in green. [0:24:34]
 The next one is sketch 1 and then loss of all the surface. [0:24:40]
 Now it's up to you if you want to create a solid. Click create a solid. [0:24:45]
 Okay and we've lofted it through from the surface all the way through the loft. [0:24:51]
 We can see the tangency on this side and if we want to change any of this we can [0:24:57]
 we're just coming back into those surface profiles. [0:25:01]
 So I'm just going to hide going to loft. I'm just going to hide the surface sketches that go around [0:25:07]
 and we'll come up and press the space box hide these and I may hide these profile ones [0:25:16]
 like so and this surface profile goes around here and just leave this line on top. [0:25:22]
 And let's go to that one. [0:25:24]
 And change this so I'm going to make another line. [0:25:32]
 The connects up here downwards. [0:25:35]
 Taking these two make them tangent. [0:25:41]
 Okay that make this one construction and we'll can move that into place. [0:25:51]
 So we may have to move these points to decide where that's going to go. [0:26:01]
 So it's something like that and it closes and we're getting nice tangent curve there. [0:26:08]
 I can click on that's. [0:26:13]
 Finally I can click on that sketch and press the space box and we have our loft to surface. [0:26:25]
 So before we finish this tutorial I think to remember I need to forgot is that this loft [0:26:34]
 is totally separate from the surface. So we need to connect these together. [0:26:38]
 We could hide loft and then come back over to the surface workbench and surface the bottom of this. [0:26:46]
 Go over to the surface and use a filling surface add an edge and work our way around the edges [0:26:56]
 to remember the last one. Okay and then come over to the part workbench. [0:27:04]
 Make sure both are selected. [0:27:08]
 Got a part compound and make compounds so they're both connected together but they're not [0:27:16]
 Booleaned into each other and then select the compound part convert to solid. [0:27:22]
 We have a solid shape now not going to hide the original compound. [0:27:28]
 No no that solid because if I have to sphere and then take the one I want to keep the one I want to [0:27:33]
 remove and do a cut on that you can see that's being removed. As controls said that and delete the sphere. [0:27:42]
 Now I can bring back my loft and Boolean these both together with the union or part [0:27:52]
 come down to the Boolean and union. We're created a single fusion which is still a solid. [0:28:04]
 If I add the sphere transform I can take the sphere away from the main body with a cut [0:28:20]
 like so. This edge is just the edge of the sphere. If I rotate the sphere around then that will [0:28:28]
 remove that from there. The other option if I want this back a bit and go back to the compound [0:28:40]
 and delete that so we've got the surface and [0:28:45]
 that's delete that surface from there and we've got the original surface so we can see [0:28:52]
 that needs surface in. We can bring in the loft at a moment loft is solid. [0:29:00]
 We'll take the loft, connect to the solid on the data tab with the loft so that that to force. [0:29:06]
 Therefore we get this continuous shell that goes around here. These two parts [0:29:15]
 will surface this over in the surface what I've been choosing the filling [0:29:23]
 at the edges working our way around the game. [0:29:27]
 Now we've got three surfaces. Well two surfaces in the loft. We've got a surface inside [0:29:38]
 the loft, control click, they have a loft and control click the surface and what we need to be in the [0:29:45]
 part where I bench and we need to compound them together so we can use the compound tool and toolbar [0:29:52]
 or part compound make compound and finally take that compound part covert solid. [0:30:01]
 The original compound press the space part to hide it and we have a solid left over [0:30:10]
 that we'll just double check. We are here [0:30:15]
 transform it. Okay, I want to keep all the more to remove and we do the cut and we can see [0:30:28]
 that's taken that sphere away from the side. The other thing is that because we're created [0:30:35]
 the compound solid that's not parametric so any changes won't affect the solid to make your [0:30:42]
 parametric spring back the compound. We can use the Curse workbench so I'm just going to delete [0:30:52]
 that compound. I've not lost I've got the surfaces. Curse workbench is an additional workbench [0:31:00]
 it can be found on the tools add on manager and we've got something in here called parametric [0:31:05]
 solid so we can take all the surfaces to track the more like so. I got to the MISC and parametric [0:31:16]
 solid. At a moment that's made a shell so you can see shape status is a shell. [0:31:22]
 That's to delete that and go back to the part and create a compound between these so I'm [0:31:31]
 control selecting the compound. Curse workbench, click the compound, MISC, parametric solid and [0:31:45]
 now that's the solid. If you compound it first then you get the solid if you don't you will get [0:31:52]
 the shell. Obviously the solid will allow you to boom in it but you may want to shell instead of [0:31:57]
 a solid totally out to you. I hope that's answered those questions I hope you find an application for [0:32:02]
 that to make your life a lot easier when you're creating your models. Look forward to seeing you in the [0:32:07]
