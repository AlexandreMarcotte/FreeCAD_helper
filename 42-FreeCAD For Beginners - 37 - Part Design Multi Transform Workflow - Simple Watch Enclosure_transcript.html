===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners - 37 - Part Design Multi Transform Workflow - Simple Watch Enclosure =====
 Hi everyone, welcome to the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning Freak [0:00:04]
 Have beginners, we teach the fundamentals of free CAD whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:09]
 Today we're going to be creating this watch face using something called multi-transform [0:00:13]
 operation in the part design. [0:00:15]
 Now, every time we're using this type of workflow is because we look at a watch, we have [0:00:20]
 symmetry across both the vertical and the horizontal. [0:00:26]
 So all we need to do is model one part of this and transform it over with a mirror. [0:00:33]
 But if we're using the part design, this can be a bit tricky. [0:00:36]
 The reason being is that if we use a mirror and then mirror this again, we won't [0:00:40]
 be able to do that. [0:00:41]
 The part design doesn't allow for a mirror of a mirror or a mirror of a pattern. [0:00:47]
 It's only subtractive and additive features that can be mirrored in the part design. [0:00:52]
 How do we get around this if we want to use a part design workflow? [0:00:55]
 And that's what I'm going to be answering in this video. [0:01:23]
 When the part design is on the grey new body, I'm going to create a new sketch. [0:01:28]
 I'm first going to rough out one called for that watch from the top view. [0:01:31]
 So we're looking at the top profile, so we're going to go along the x, y plane and hit [0:01:35]
 OK. [0:01:36]
 For this, I'm going to be using a circle for the construction geometry. [0:01:41]
 This is just to get us an idea of the actual diameter of the watch face. [0:01:45]
 So here the sketch is going to pass point back and I'm going to click on the circle and [0:01:49]
 use the tool construction mode. [0:01:51]
 This won't sharp when we're modeling. [0:01:54]
 Now we can set the diameter. [0:01:56]
 I'm going to go 40 millimeters. [0:02:02]
 This is gets us into the basic dimensions for our project and now we can start sketching. [0:02:09]
 The connection points of where the struct connects to. [0:02:12]
 The lobes are going to sit around about here. [0:02:16]
 So that's sketch those in. [0:02:18]
 I'm going to use the polyline and all I'm going to do is create the top view of that [0:02:27]
 connection point. [0:02:29]
 In here, a scape, a scape, a game to get the mass point back and just place in a vertical [0:02:34]
 constraint there. [0:02:35]
 I've got the ultra remove redundants, the ultra constraints and avoid redundant or [0:02:40]
 constraints all checked. [0:02:42]
 So you can see they're constrained straight to this circle here. [0:02:46]
 We'll point an ultra constraint. [0:02:49]
 Now that's used the arc, the end point of end point of end point of end point arc. [0:02:53]
 I'm going to go from this point and connect up. [0:02:57]
 I make this tangent to here. [0:03:00]
 I'm going to do the same with this one. [0:03:02]
 Connect up and make it tangent so you can see I'm just touching that line and that places [0:03:09]
 that arc tangent to this constraint geometry. [0:03:14]
 That's just some distances away. [0:03:15]
 So I'm going to say that these two points for the struct connection. [0:03:20]
 Here's that 10 millimeters. [0:03:22]
 I'm going to set the width of the struct connection at four mil and we set the distance [0:03:34]
 away from this point and this point with a length of 25 mil. [0:03:42]
 See this point needs to be attached to this vertical line, point on object constraint and [0:03:49]
 the same for this point as well on this line. [0:03:54]
 Now for the constraint, let's close the sketch and see what we have. [0:03:58]
 So we have this basic template here. [0:04:03]
 This is going to be used as a cut-in tool later when we come to do the top profile of the [0:04:08]
 watch. [0:04:10]
 We're now going to take a cross section, going across here so if we layered this flat [0:04:14]
 looking at it from the side, we need to take a cross section of here and we're going to [0:04:18]
 revolve this around the watch. [0:04:20]
 If this was something like, say, an overwatch, then we'll do the same thing but we instead [0:04:25]
 of using a revolve, we'll use a sweep along the path. [0:04:29]
 That's create the profile. [0:04:31]
 I'm going to create a new sketch and I'm going to go along the exit plane and here [0:04:38]
 okay. [0:04:40]
 This is positioned this in the middle of our scene, we can see how our art goes around [0:04:46]
 and we can use this point as reference. [0:04:50]
 So I'm going to pull in this point, that gives me an idea of where that's going to sit and [0:04:56]
 where our profile is going to sit as well. [0:04:59]
 Now let's look how our profile is going to hit a scape, now I'll point back, I'm going [0:05:03]
 to place one point in here and this is going to be the height of the profile. [0:05:09]
 This just gets me in the necessary dimensions for the watch. [0:05:16]
 I'm going to go 10mm. [0:05:18]
 Now I can position this on the screen and start thinking about the profile itself. [0:05:27]
 This is where your choice of profile comes in. [0:05:30]
 I'm going to create something in here, start with an arc, then I'm going to go for the [0:05:38]
 polyline and come down and have hats down again and across, down to the bottom, across [0:05:50]
 the bottom and it's just figuring out what the watch would look like if we did the cross [0:05:55]
 section. [0:05:56]
 Finish this by coming across and up and connect up. [0:06:02]
 Here's a scape, I'm going to get a mass point back and we need to add some constraints [0:06:07]
 in here. [0:06:08]
 So we're looking at some horizontal constraints which is there, we'll bring this cross [0:06:16]
 a bit and we can start constrain this down, this has got to be vertical, horizontal [0:06:22]
 constraints. [0:06:24]
 We'll start to make some of these equal so I'm going to take this one and this one, [0:06:29]
 make those equal and these are horizontal constraints. [0:06:34]
 I'm going to place this one, this point here in line with this point. [0:06:41]
 Now we can start moving these about just to get the right shape that we need. [0:06:48]
 I'm going to make this one, one millimeter, so we'll start to get some lengths in here. [0:07:00]
 I'll also make this one one millimeter, so make those two equal, height of this five [0:07:07]
 mill and say this one is free mill. [0:07:15]
 We're just going through and answer rough dimensions to get this constraint down. [0:07:22]
 Right yes, so about three millimeters on the right yes as well. [0:07:29]
 It's made these two equal. [0:07:38]
 Let's slowly start to constrain this down. [0:08:08]
 Once our sketch is constrained then we can close and we see what we have. [0:08:15]
 We have this sketch to be revolved. [0:08:19]
 So this is the watch profile and this one is the top guide. [0:08:32]
 Let's revolve this to click on the watch profile. [0:08:36]
 That design, add it to the feature and the revolve. [0:08:41]
 You can see how that's revolved but we only want 90 degrees, so let's go 90 degrees. [0:08:48]
 And take some edge cut to plain off and reverse, we'll place it along here. [0:08:53]
 I hear okay we've got our cross section revolve but we still need to do the arms. [0:08:59]
 Now there are many ways to do this by using something like a reverse pocket or modeling [0:09:04]
 this with lofts. [0:09:05]
 We're going to be using a reverse pocket and this is the reason why I did this top sketch [0:09:09]
 here. [0:09:11]
 We need to add some geometry onto here to allow for this part. [0:09:17]
 If we revolve around here with that geometry it molds in nicely. [0:09:22]
 So that's have a look at the revolution coming to that and look at the sketch profile. [0:09:26]
 Don't click it. [0:09:30]
 And we can see that we've got this part here which we can come out with and connect [0:09:36]
 up to the bottom. [0:09:38]
 This will create our connection point. [0:09:43]
 But first we need to know the length of this connection. [0:09:46]
 So if we're coming out here how far it's going to be out, as close that and come back [0:09:51]
 to the top guide. [0:09:53]
 And they can see we've got a number of dimensions in here so we need to know the length [0:09:58]
 of this as it would be if it was included with the revolve. [0:10:03]
 That's easily done. [0:10:04]
 I'm coming in and adding a circle coming out. [0:10:09]
 Connecting the circle up with the point on circle constraint or point on object constraint [0:10:16]
 and changing this to construction geometry. [0:10:20]
 From that I can take a measurement. [0:10:22]
 So we're going to add a point to here. [0:10:25]
 Because the string the point to this line, the vertical axis, we'll point on object constraint. [0:10:36]
 Now can take a length from here to here using vertical distance and change this to reference. [0:10:42]
 You can see it's going to orange. [0:10:44]
 Change that to reference here okay. [0:10:48]
 We got a length that we can use. [0:10:50]
 So 8.6531. [0:10:52]
 So I'm going to use that for the length of my feature. [0:10:56]
 I'll close that and come back to the watch profile. [0:11:00]
 Zoom in and I'm going to place a point here. [0:11:04]
 That's a distance away from these two of 8.65. [0:11:12]
 Here enter. [0:11:13]
 So we've got our distance. [0:11:20]
 Now we can delete this line and add in lines that we need to connect up. [0:11:29]
 So I'm going to go something like this. [0:11:35]
 Connect up our line and we're place a line in here as well. [0:11:40]
 Here's a scape and place vertical constraint. [0:11:46]
 Now we need to add some more constraints in here so I'm going to take these two points. [0:11:51]
 Keep them in line and set a length in here. [0:11:58]
 So you want point five millimeters. [0:12:08]
 So we just add in some more constraints and we're back to fully constrained. [0:12:17]
 Let's close that. [0:12:18]
 Now you can see our revolve has changed. [0:12:22]
 Now this is where we create the reverse pocket. [0:12:28]
 We have the top guide here. [0:12:30]
 So if I hover over that you can see the top guide. [0:12:32]
 I'm going to duplicate that top guide. [0:12:35]
 Let's do a little bit of object. [0:12:37]
 Take out the x, y, planes. [0:12:38]
 We don't need that. [0:12:39]
 We just want the top guide. [0:12:40]
 Hit OK. [0:12:42]
 Then make sure that this is inside the body. [0:12:44]
 Watch it as this means I can edit this sketch. [0:12:49]
 We've leave in the upper one intact. [0:12:50]
 If we've reached the upper one in our geometry we may get it as a problem when we start [0:12:55]
 changing their sketch. [0:12:56]
 So the first thing I'm going to do is come into the sketch and few section. [0:13:02]
 We've got this geometry in here. [0:13:04]
 That's just delete this one. [0:13:06]
 We don't need it. [0:13:07]
 And also this point. [0:13:09]
 And I'm going to remove the construction geometry as well. [0:13:12]
 We don't need that. [0:13:13]
 Now I'm going to add some geometry. [0:13:15]
 I'm going to take the line and create a line going all the way up here and connect up. [0:13:21]
 We must keep this symmetrical. [0:13:23]
 So we mustn't go over this line. [0:13:26]
 Because I'm adding new geometry to this then this is the reason why I've copied it. [0:13:30]
 It's because the other one is referencing that geometry and we may get into some topological [0:13:36]
 naming issues. [0:13:37]
 So I'm just adding the lines in to create this sketch here. [0:13:42]
 Now this line has to come into here. [0:13:46]
 Connect up. [0:13:48]
 And what we've done if you look quite hard to see but when we come out of this sketch, we [0:13:55]
 have got basically a cookie cutter here. [0:13:59]
 So we've got this square that connects up and then we've got this bit. [0:14:03]
 So without lined this part here, if I hit close and just hide the revolution, we can [0:14:10]
 see what we've got. [0:14:13]
 When we use this in the pocket against the revolution, for us in the space part, just [0:14:17]
 to show that, we're going to leave whatever is in here. [0:14:22]
 Let's bring about the revolution, click the top guide 001, which we've just edited and [0:14:28]
 used the pocket. [0:14:30]
 Now let's go through all. [0:14:32]
 And because we're pocketing downwards, we need to click reverse. [0:14:37]
 Let's take the material away from there and you can see what we've been left with. [0:14:42]
 So we've got one quarter of the watch. [0:14:44]
 I see it okay. [0:14:45]
 And let's have a look to see what we've got. [0:14:49]
 So we've got this nice feature here. [0:14:53]
 Now at this point we can do some finishing on here so we could add, say, a fillet. [0:14:58]
 Just here. [0:14:59]
 You may want to add the holes before you want to do this, so place a hole in here, going [0:15:06]
 through to the other side. [0:15:08]
 But I'm just going to add a quick fillet onto here as though we've added that hole. [0:15:16]
 Like so, okay. [0:15:19]
 And the next thing I'm going to do is use the multi-transform in here. [0:15:23]
 The reason why we use multi-transform is that if we use the normal mirror, and this is [0:15:29]
 just for the part design workflow, if I use the mirror in here, that's saved this before [0:15:34]
 we do anything else. [0:15:38]
 So that's saved now. [0:15:40]
 You notice that when I've selected these we use revolution and walk our way down the [0:15:46]
 tree view. [0:15:47]
 So we've got the revolution. [0:15:48]
 Control-click the pocket, control-click the fillet. [0:15:51]
 This means when we do the mirror, we get the revolution first. [0:15:53]
 Just the pocket and then the fillet. [0:15:55]
 We can't mirror the fillet on its own. [0:15:59]
 We have to do all those actions as one. [0:16:02]
 So we hit that, we get the mirror of this. [0:16:06]
 If we hit okay, we can't do a mirror of a mirror. [0:16:10]
 So we're clicking the mirror and trying to mirror that. [0:16:13]
 You can see it only as if it's attractive features can be transformed. [0:16:17]
 This is where, then we just lead that person to lead key on the keyboard. [0:16:21]
 This is where the multi-transform comes in. [0:16:24]
 This one here, create multi-transform. [0:16:27]
 We're going to have to select in sequence of how they've been built, the actions or [0:16:33]
 the operations that we use to create this part for watch. [0:16:38]
 Part design, apply pattern, create multi-transform. [0:16:43]
 What happens when we click it, we get this panel on the left. [0:16:46]
 That's asking us to right click to add a transformation. [0:16:50]
 We've got the revolution, the pocket and the fillet within, which is correct. [0:16:55]
 Right click and then we get the different transformations here. [0:16:59]
 So we want to add a mirror transformation. [0:17:02]
 We've got our mirror. [0:17:04]
 Now I like to come down and check that we're on the right plane. [0:17:08]
 So if we go base, y's there plane. [0:17:12]
 We've got that one there. [0:17:14]
 If I hit okay, what can then do without hitting okay at the top is right click again. [0:17:20]
 And add a mirror transformation. [0:17:23]
 We can then come down and add a second transformation using saying the base xo plane. [0:17:30]
 And we go transformation. [0:17:32]
 Come up here okay. [0:17:39]
 That applies the transformation. [0:17:41]
 And we have our end result. [0:17:45]
 So I hope this helps you understand the multi-transformation. [0:17:49]
 Also how you attack or something like a watch face. [0:17:52]
