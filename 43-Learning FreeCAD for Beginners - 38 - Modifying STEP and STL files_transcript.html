===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD for Beginners - 38 - Modifying STEP and STL files =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of the Learning [0:00:04]
 FreeCalford begins. Today we're going to be looking at two file types and then the most common [0:00:08]
 file types that we see in the world of CAD and 3D and that's STL files and step files. [0:00:14]
 We're going to be learning the difference between those two files and how to manipulate those [0:00:17]
 in free CAD so we can understand how to use files that we can download from the internet or [0:00:23]
 that are given to us by someone else and work on those and remakes those. I'm going to be using [0:00:28]
 a part that I've made in free CAD and the exported versions of those in both STL and step to demonstrate [0:00:35]
 this subject. So I hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a look at these two file types. [0:00:39]
 If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a co-fire or a coffee site [0:00:44]
 that you can donate to if you so desire and that's at kohyphenfide.com, full slash mhng0, [0:00:53]

 So look at the model that I've designed we can see we have a body here that we've [0:01:10]
 printed in something like the part design, number of operations and we end with the fillet. [0:01:15]
 When I export this out from say file, export we get a number of file types to choose from. [0:01:21]
 We're interested in the STL and the step fault. Now notice that STL is both STL and [0:01:27]
 ASTL, one sub binary version, the STL and the AST is an ASCY version. So that is text. [0:01:35]
 It's advisable to go for the binary version, the STL and that's defined by actually supplying [0:01:41]
 the dot STL or the dot AST on the end of the file name. We also got the step file. [0:01:48]
 Let's got two file extensions, one stop STEP and the other one stop STP. You can select [0:01:54]
 EVRA or says a case that you're selecting it and using the save to export out. There are settings [0:02:02]
 in free CAD, go to the preferences and go into import export and we look along here we can see step [0:02:13]
 and we can decide what we want to change in that. The step file that's exported is here on the right [0:02:21]
 and you can see there's a difference between the step and the STL. The step file looks very similar [0:02:28]
 to what's been built actually in free CAD for the part design. But it doesn't have all the [0:02:35]
 operations that will not come across in any step file. This is the geometry of the object itself, [0:02:42]
 not the actions or the operations that make it up. The STL file, this one on the left, you can see [0:02:48]
 straight away there's a difference. If I hover over the step file all the faces are separated and [0:02:55]
 all the edges are separated from that model as per the free CAD build. Whereas the STL, [0:03:02]
 it's all one face. As you can see the whole lot is highlighting as I hover over it. [0:03:11]
 Whereas the step we can select the edges, the faces etc. This is quite important when it [0:03:23]
 comes to editing these geometries. Now STL stands for standard triangle language or standard [0:03:29]
 test-lation language and we can see that from this model when we convert it to a part. So at the [0:03:36]
 moment this is actually a mesh. So we're going to use the part workbench to change the STL into a [0:03:42]
 part. If I click on it we can see that it is in fact a mesh. So first thing we're going to do is [0:03:51]
 convert this to a shape. You can't tap on it and create shape from mesh. It's going to ask us to [0:03:57]
 sew the shape and this closes any gaps in our object. So let's click on the sewing and we get [0:04:04]
 into the tolerance for the sewing of the shape. I'm going to leave it with the defaults and hit OK. [0:04:09]
 Now the shape is sewn we can see a number of edges and faces have appeared. If we roll over this [0:04:15]
 you can see it's still flashing as one face. This is because the STL is still visible as [0:04:21]
 press the spacebar to hide it and now you can see the faces are being highlighted. What we need to do [0:04:28]
 is bring this around and reduce the amount of information that's in this shape. You notice that [0:04:35]
 these here are playing our surfaces. This one here and this one here and you can see the triangles in [0:04:42]
 here and this is the Tastulation in an STL file. That's fixed that by coming over to the part that's [0:04:50]
 been created as a shape. And come up to part and come down to create a copy and refine shape. [0:04:57]
 This will refine the shape. It will also fix problems with the placement before we refine the [0:05:03]
 shape. Let's have a look at the placement. Come up to the view. Toggle axis cross. See what [0:05:10]
 will access crosses. Now let's click on this demo part which we converted and right click and hit [0:05:18]
 transform. Notice that the handler for transformation is at the point of origin. So this is where [0:05:26]
 it's been built and handlers here. That's move this. So what we need to do is take the object [0:05:34]
 and place it where we want it to be using our axis cross in our scene. So I want the point of origin [0:05:44]
 about here. That's here. Okay. Now we'll click on this part. Go on to part. [0:05:51]
 Create a copy and refine shape. Not only will that fix the plane of faces. So our face will be reduced [0:06:02]
 on this top. It will also fix the point of rotation. Now when we look at the object, [0:06:08]
 we can see that the plane of faces are now all one face. And we've got this one here. So it's [0:06:18]
 reducing information in our model. But we still got this testination in here. These individual faces. [0:06:24]
 There is one more step we have to do. Let's click on our refined part. Cut part and convert to [0:06:33]
 solid. We now have a solid in here. That's hide the previous part. And with that solid we can create [0:06:42]
 such things as Boolean operations, splits, etc. So the only way to work with this is by using split [0:06:51]
 apart and Boolean operations to separate this out at new features in there, at new geometry in there. [0:06:57]
 And I actually do this in another video where I look at a landing gear and I'll place the link of [0:07:02]
 that in the description and the thumbnail location on this video at this point. So let's venture [0:07:08]
 in downloading as till a fast from the web and remix in those via freecat. I'm just going to come [0:07:13]
 over to Google and type in grabcat free stl. And we go to grabcat site. Now this is a free site that [0:07:22]
 we can sign up to and it has a large number of free stl files, step files, three model files or many [0:07:29]
 different varieties. And you'll find what type of file is normally underneath here. So this is an [0:07:35]
 stl file. And what I'm going to do is find something to download and we're going to see the difference [0:07:40]
 it's been between the two and how easy is to remix some of them. So I'm just looking through and [0:07:50]
 trying to find one. So this is an stl file here, this one. So this is kind of something that we could [0:07:57]
 download. This is quite useful. And we might want to remix that add extra holes, extra ventilation [0:08:05]
 or some kind of feature on that. This is a nest hill file. So we come down and can see the [0:08:10]
 stl file here. And we're going to download one of these. That's download this one. This part here. [0:08:18]
 And we hit download file. So you can see I've downloaded a number of step nest hill files already here. [0:08:26]
 Just get an idea of what's out there. This one I haven't seen before. So we've got our main [0:08:32]
 stl file. Over in free CAD I've already started a new document. I can't read it in the part design. [0:08:38]
 That may change. Let's go to file and import and come down to the file. [0:08:44]
 And over that up. Now when we roll over this you can see that it's one single face. [0:08:54]
 The first thing I do with these type of files is come out of the mesh design and see if they're made [0:09:00]
 up of components. When somebody's made up of components, this is like using the part workbench [0:09:07]
 and the compound object. So it's saving out a compound object. A single output with multiple objects [0:09:12]
 for them. To check that, let's click on the S-Till file. And come up to meshes. [0:09:17]
 Ango split by components. As you can see there's only one component. So we'll delete that. [0:09:24]
 So we've got no luck there. The trouble with this is that we can't really split it down into faces. [0:09:32]
 We can use building operations against it. We can pull it into a part design workflow as well. [0:09:37]
 As a base object. But the first thing we need to do is convert this to a shape. [0:09:42]
 To do that, we come over to the part. Click on the S-Till file and come up to part [0:09:50]
 and create shape for mesh. This is a mesh at the end of the day. Once we click that, [0:09:56]
 it's going to ask us to sew the shape. I normally take the defaults. This will close in a gaps [0:10:03]
 in the shape. That could cause problems in the future. Let's hit OK. This may take a little while [0:10:08]
 depending on how complex it objects is. As you can see, we can see that there's a number of faces in [0:10:16]
 if I come over and hide the mesh. We can now roll over these faces and we can see them there. [0:10:22]
 Now, if we look, these faces are all along the same plane. We can merge faces that are on the [0:10:32]
 same plane. By clicking on the shape and coming up to part and come down to create a copy [0:10:39]
 and refine shape. When we click on that, it will create a copy and refine it, [0:10:47]
 taking out all those faces that are on the same plane. As you can see, we've got a much cleaner shape. [0:10:52]
 And we can select the faces. So we've got more of a chance of creating a successful loft pad, [0:11:04]
 pocket, etc. with this object. It makes our life a lot easier. We could use the part [0:11:11]
 workbench and say create a cylinder. And transform that if we want to use a part workflow [0:11:21]
 and say OK, I want to keep the one we want to remove. Controls that them both. I use a cut. [0:11:30]
 So you can see simple boon operations take effect quite easy on that. Controls said that. [0:11:38]
 We can also select the faces as usual and create sketches on there. [0:11:42]
 Mapping the flat face and creating what we want on here. [0:11:50]
 Using boon operations to a strewd and remove that part. If you want to use this, say in a [0:12:00]
 part design workflow, we can come over to the part design and create a body. [0:12:07]
 And drop the shape inside the body. This will create a base reference. The shape will be made [0:12:17]
 invisible so this is the refined shape. Once that base feature has been added, we can select the face [0:12:25]
 create sketch and create some geometry on here such as a slot. It close. [0:12:33]
 Select sketch and pocket that. Notice that the objects has disappeared. This tells me something. [0:12:41]
 That there is enough a step what we have to do. So let's cancel that. [0:12:45]
 I'm going to delete the base feature and the sketch from the body. [0:12:52]
 And bring back our shape. Our shape is probably not a solid. It's probably a shell. [0:12:59]
 So let's come back to the part and come out to the part and convert to solid. [0:13:08]
 That's now converted to a solid and we can hide the shape. [0:13:13]
 Now when we take this solid and place it into the body, you'll create the base feature. [0:13:21]
 Let's see what luck we have now. So I'm going to come over to the part design. [0:13:26]
 And select the face. Create sketch. This will map flat face to the object [0:13:36]
 and then create a slot. It close. And now we take that sketch and create the pocket. [0:13:46]
 One thing you'll notice is how slow this is running and this is because of the STL file. [0:13:54]
 This was a step file then this will be much quicker. [0:13:57]
 So we can see we've got art taken there so the pocket has now taken because it's a solid. [0:14:03]
 Previously it was a shell. Let's see the difference with a step file. [0:14:08]
 So we've got the step file back and you can see it's made up with faces, [0:14:14]
 edges, vertices, etc. We can use the same process of parts split apart [0:14:20]
 or Boolean operations in here. For instance I can take this sphere. [0:14:26]
 Click the one I want to kick, control click the one I want to remove and use [0:14:30]
 Union and Boolean options in here. Union that in there. It controls that and let's say a cut. [0:14:39]
 So you can see how quick that is compared to the STL file. Controls that up and delete that [0:14:47]
 set. Another way of breaking this part and remix it is coming up to the draft workbench. [0:14:53]
 Within the draft workbench we have a number of tools. One of which is the modifications [0:14:59]
 and upgrade and downgrade. These downgrade the selected object into simpler shapes. [0:15:04]
 The result will depend on the type of object that you downgrade in or upgrade. For instance [0:15:10]
 if we take the step file. If we downgrade this we get a number of faces. So at the moment all the [0:15:16]
 faces are connected together. Let's come up to the modifications and use downgrade. [0:15:20]
 Look what happens with the trivia. We have a number of faces in here. [0:15:26]
 For click on one you can see the faces high on the left hand side. Press the spacebar [0:15:33]
 and we can see inside that object. So this allows us to remove parts of the object. For instance [0:15:42]
 I may want to remove these top faces here by hitting the lead. [0:15:47]
 That's the lead. This part is well. Maybe this part. [0:15:58]
 We have rid of the internals in here. I can now come over to the part workbench. [0:16:04]
 I will start filling in parts of this. We will say a rule surface. [0:16:10]
 Or you can come over to the surface workbench. [0:16:13]
 Create a digital geometry to gain this and create surface that link up. [0:16:19]
 Let's come back to the part workbench. [0:16:24]
 Start using something like the rule surface. [0:16:28]
 Create surfaces against here. [0:16:30]
 Let's close this gap. [0:16:33]
 Let's first start creating a surface against here. [0:16:37]
 We are going to cross, control clicking those edges. [0:16:40]
 Rule surface and the rule surface against these two. [0:16:44]
 Using the rule surface. [0:16:47]
 I will close the gap by taking these edges. [0:16:51]
 Using the rule surface. [0:16:54]
 Now I can close the gap across here. We should leave me a nice curve because [0:17:00]
 it is going to follow the contour of these surfaces. [0:17:03]
 We look at this. We can see this is curved outwards. [0:17:07]
 This curve and this edge and create a rule surface. [0:17:16]
 You can see how that is going in there. We have a bold going outwards. [0:17:22]
 We could do this with the surface in workbench. [0:17:27]
 Create a sketch in here with an arc. [0:17:30]
 Surface gains those. We have got videos of how to create surfaces with sketches in the learning [0:17:38]
 free CAD series and the same applies to this. [0:17:41]
 Let's come around to the other side and close this surface here. [0:17:46]
 I am going to use the arc and this edge. [0:17:52]
 Control click those and create rule surface. [0:17:54]
 I will create this feature in here. [0:18:02]
 So we have changed our geometry. [0:18:05]
 We can obviously use the splitting to split this apart and we can rejoin these all back together. [0:18:12]
 I will click in the mall. [0:18:14]
 Let's see the rules. [0:18:17]
 Making sure that we come into the rule surface we have the other faces as well. [0:18:23]
 Like so, control click in those and the same with this one. [0:18:27]
 I can see if missed to so I am going to control the set. [0:18:36]
 Those faces from here. [0:18:37]
 We need to be in the draft workbench. [0:18:43]
 Modifications upgrade. [0:18:46]
 We now have a shell. [0:18:49]
 We have got a shell there. That means we have missed some faces. [0:18:54]
 You can see two faces will be missed there. [0:18:56]
 If we missed the faces then we can control select those faces. [0:19:00]
 And then come out to modifications and upgrade. [0:19:04]
 Therefore we have this continuous object. [0:19:08]
 And I can come back to the part workbench. [0:19:13]
 Click on that shell. [0:19:15]
 Part convert to solid. [0:19:18]
 Now we have a solid. [0:19:20]
 So I have started new document and we are going to look at a stepfile now. [0:19:25]
 I have chosen this one here and this can be downloaded from grabcat again. [0:19:32]
 I have just done a step step. [0:19:35]
 This time I have come up to the search and just typed in step in here. [0:19:38]
 And I have chosen this one here. [0:19:41]
 I have already downloaded it. [0:19:42]
 So let's come to free card file and come down to the import. [0:19:47]
 And let's come down to the file itself. [0:19:51]
 And straight away you can see that we have just got faces in here. [0:19:59]
 And this is also a solid object. [0:20:02]
 So we don't have to do any refinement. [0:20:03]
 We don't have to do any creation of the solid object. [0:20:07]
 It's make sure it's a solid not a shell. [0:20:09]
 On the left hand side you also see that because this is part of an assembly. [0:20:16]
 We have got all of the individual parts in here. [0:20:20]
 So this is very similar to the STL file if we had something similar in the STL. [0:20:26]
 And we had components in there. [0:20:27]
 We would come up to the mesh design and split by components. [0:20:31]
 And each of these individual parts will be a component. [0:20:35]
 But there will be one face, one face per component. [0:20:39]
 As you can see we have got multiple faces in here. [0:20:41]
 And we can use these in the part design and the part workbench quite easily. [0:20:47]
 And they are a lot faster. [0:20:48]
 So now the operation is done against these. [0:20:51]
 We'll be very similar speed to what we would be doing in a normal freecat model. [0:20:56]
 As if they were creative via freecat. [0:20:57]
 If we want to use one of these parts in the part design. [0:21:01]
 We would have to say take this part here and drag it outside of its container. [0:21:11]
 So it sits outside. [0:21:14]
 Then we'll create a new body. [0:21:15]
 We can drag that in. [0:21:17]
 Like so. [0:21:19]
 It's a great base feature. [0:21:20]
 We can't, for the lid out of base feature. [0:21:23]
 Drag them straight from inside the container into that body. [0:21:28]
 It just won't allow us to drag it out first. [0:21:31]
 Also one thing to be aware of in the part workbench. [0:21:36]
 If we come down to this drop down, that's the part workbench. [0:21:41]
 It's that we got a defeaturing tool in the part workbench. [0:21:45]
 So if I took this part here, that's hide the others, [0:21:50]
 but present the space bottom. [0:21:51]
 And if I've got a feature in here that I don't want. [0:21:56]
 Let's say I don't want these ears here. [0:22:00]
 Or just one of them. [0:22:01]
 I can click on it and cut apart and come down to defeaturing. [0:22:07]
 That will remove that face. [0:22:09]
 So you can see that face has been removed. [0:22:12]
 Let's try and have one that's both of these part defeaturing. [0:22:18]
 And you can see that wasn't removed. [0:22:20]
 So you can see we can have some success with this. [0:22:23]
 And other times some of the features aren't removed. [0:22:26]
 So that one's being removed there. [0:22:28]
 And let's left this. [0:22:29]
 It's going to control said that. [0:22:31]
 We could use a normal pocket in here so we could pocket these out. [0:22:37]
 Sometimes the defeaturing will get us to a stage at beneficial. [0:22:42]
 Other times not. [0:22:44]
 Once we got this into our body as a base feature, [0:22:51]
 then we can add sketches to here in the part design. [0:22:56]
 Let's come back to the part design. [0:22:57]
 And so that this face and create a sketch. [0:23:00]
 And we could select what we want on here. [0:23:03]
 So that's create a slot. [0:23:05]
 And now to our constraints, we can pull the geometry. [0:23:09]
 So for instance, I can pull in this line here. [0:23:13]
 And it makes the symmetry. [0:23:17]
 Okay, at this point. [0:23:18]
 Let's make a good constraint. [0:23:20]
 And that's close. [0:23:23]
 And we can pocket that. [0:23:25]
 So make sure that sketches are selected and pocket they. [0:23:28]
 And set our depth. [0:23:33]
 Features like this while we're going to have to use something like a pad to fill in that gap. [0:23:43]
 Like so. [0:23:52]
 And then close that. [0:23:53]
 We'll pad that. [0:23:56]
 Reverse. [0:24:00]
 And set the distance. [0:24:03]
 Okay. [0:24:10]
 Click on the pad. [0:24:12]
 And we can come down to the refined has true. [0:24:16]
 And that removes that from there. [0:24:19]
 So you can see the STL file is quite easy to work with. [0:24:22]
 So I hope that's given you a quick insight of how to use the STL files and step files. [0:24:27]
 The differences between them and how you can use those in the part design or the part workbench. [0:24:32]
 And reconfigure them how you want. [0:24:34]
