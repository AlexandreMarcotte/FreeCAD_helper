===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD for Beginners - 39 - Sub Assemblies in A2 Plus - Chest of Drawers =====
 Hi everyone and welcome to the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning Free [0:00:04]
 Cafe for beginners, we're teaching those fundamentals of free-canned from beginner [0:00:08]
 perspective, learning workflows and giving a practical example whilst we learn [0:00:13]
 those workflows. Today we're looking at subassemblies. Now we're going to be using the [0:00:18]
 A2 plus workbench and the part workbench. We're going to be creating a really super [0:00:24]
 simple subassembly with super simple parts. So the example is this very small [0:00:31]
 Chester draws. So we've got two draws in here and the receptacle which is [0:00:36]
 basically two boxes on top of each other. So we can move these draws in and out. [0:00:42]
 And these draws are assemblies. So these are subassemblies and this is a [0:00:53]
 subassembly as well. So these are two different parts within this chest. So this [0:00:59]
 chest itself is a subassembly because we can import that into say a desk assembly [0:01:05]
 and that can act as a subassembly and the subassembly has a assembly so I'll [0:01:10]
 attach to it. We're going to be learning how to do those and we're going to be [0:01:13]
 learning simple constraints in there as well. So I'm going to be using the [0:01:17]
 access constraint to constraint one draw and the planes, quince, didn't constraint. [0:01:23]
 To good strain the other draw. So I hope you enjoy this series and let's have a look [0:01:28]
 at this workflow. If you'd like we see you want to donate to the channel then you can do [0:01:32]
 so via PayPal at PayPal.com. For slash PayPal me, for slash Darren B Eastone or at [0:01:39]
 coffee via kho-hifinf.com, 4 slash m-a-n-g-0. I'll also run a patron week and get early [0:01:48]
 access and additional content and that's at patreon.com, 4 slash mango jelly solutions. [0:01:54]
 Links can be found in the channel header on the about page or in the descriptions of these [0:01:59]
 videos. So we can start by creating a really simple subassembly with the primitive parts [0:02:06]
 in the partwork bench. We're going to later include the A2 plus in our workflow. We're [0:02:11]
 going to first start with new document and create some primitive parts. We're going to be [0:02:17]
 using the cylinder and the sphere and these create our draw handle. We're going to [0:02:25]
 control select the cylinder and control select the sphere and use the fusion from the toolbar [0:02:31]
 to fusion those together as one object. And you can see in the left hand side we have [0:02:38]
 the fusion icon which we can right click and rename and change that to handle. Once we have [0:02:45]
 our handle we can save this as a part. So I'm going to create a new folder and call this [0:02:52]
 parts. In here I'm going to save all my parts for this assembly and we call this one handle. [0:02:58]
 We'll save it and now we can move on to a new document and we start to build the base of the [0:03:06]
 draw. We're going to create a cube in there and we're going to resize that cube using the length [0:03:11]
 to give it say 50mm and then we'll give it some depth by the width again 50mm and some height [0:03:21]
 of 25mm. We're now going to take the top face and use the drop down menu and the part and use [0:03:29]
 the thickness to create a space inside that draw also over from the menu. Let's change this to [0:03:38]
 intersection for the join type and increase this to about 5mm. At the moment it's going outwards [0:03:46]
 that's send this inwards by doing a minus 5. It's still a bit wide so I'm going to send it inwards [0:03:52]
 by doing minus 3 and hit OK now I've got the thickness in there that's create a hole by using the [0:04:01]
 cylinder and right click and transform in this interplace. This will create the connection point [0:04:08]
 for our handle. We just change the rotation increments down to 15 and move this into place. [0:04:14]
 Once it's moved into place we can then use Boolean Cut to take this away from this section. [0:04:26]
 So what we'll do is just place it around about the center and we'll adjust that afterwards that's [0:04:33]
 it OK and you can see that the cylinder is just poking out the front of that face that's [0:04:39]
 bringing that forwards a bit to make sure we have a successful cut. We're going to cut that [0:04:44]
 away from that object. So let's take the box and the cylinder, contract those and use the cut. [0:04:52]
 This will create a cut in our object. It's a crate of the hole in there. It's not centered [0:05:01]
 if we want to center it where we can come in here and click on the cylinder. We know the thickness [0:05:07]
 of the cube, well the width and the length is 50 millimeters so we can take the cylinder down [0:05:14]
 and look at the placement and set that up as a position. Well the x is 25. [0:05:20]
 I'm going to save this by first renaming the cut and I'm just going to call this box [0:05:30]
 and now we can save as box. So we go hand or on a box at the moment. This has got a height of 25. [0:05:45]
 So what we're going to do now is create another box in a new document. So another box [0:05:54]
 or another cube and come in and we'll set the width we don't want in the position. [0:06:04]
 The width is 50 and the length is 50 and the height has 30. So we've got this one here. [0:06:16]
 We're going to hold this out from the front face. I'll take the front face and we come up [0:06:22]
 and use the thickness from the toolbar or part thickness. [0:06:27]
 Send the thickness outwards and we'll change it to intersection and we send it outwards say [0:06:38]
 two mil. That's okay that's take the thickness and rename that to container. [0:06:48]
 And I save that document. It has container. So we build in a basic simple draw system. [0:07:04]
 Now we'll go out three parts. That's great and simply of these in the A2 plus workbench. [0:07:12]
 So remember we have to have it installed on the add-on manager and you'll find A2 plus in there. [0:07:17]
 I'm going to come over to the A2 plus workbench which we've already got installed. [0:07:22]
 And that's closed these documents. So let's get rid of these documents and create a new one. [0:07:32]
 I'm going to call this say the straight way as chest assembly. [0:07:39]
 I'm going to start importing parts in here. So let's come in and click on the add shape from external [0:07:51]
 file. Also available from A2 plus add shapes from a style file. And let's go to the container [0:08:00]
 and I'll click that. So we're pulling in the container from here the one we've made and [0:08:07]
 important that. So we've got this one here. It's a static shape. So it's got a fixed position of [0:08:15]
 true so we must have one shape that is fixed in there. So that won't move. And I'm going to create [0:08:24]
 enough of one of these as well. And we're going to constrain it to the top. We can do that by clicking [0:08:30]
 on it and coming up to the create a jucco as a part or we can import it again. [0:08:36]
 Add shapes from a style file, don't click the container and select the container. If we had [0:08:43]
 more than one shape in here then we can select multiples. I see them pulled out. This won't be [0:08:48]
 attached to our mouse pointer so I can drop that anywhere I want and then I can start constrain [0:08:53]
 in from constraints. I'm going to use the edge here and control select this edge. And align the [0:09:03]
 axis with those two and I set that and we'll do the same on the other side so I can [0:09:11]
 use the side as well so I can take those two. There's many ways to do in this. So we take that one. [0:09:20]
 And actually I might take the point so at the moment I can move this out the way so if I click on [0:09:28]
 and use the move and that's the same as right click transform. I can move it out the way and [0:09:37]
 I can take say this point here by zooming and if I grab this point so I've grab that [0:09:45]
 vertex and control clicked this vertex. I can use a point on point constraint and I set that. [0:09:52]
 I could done the same on this side as well. So we've got those joined together. [0:10:00]
 I'm now going to save this and that's one subassembly. That's come over to a new document [0:10:11]
 and create another assembly. This is going to be the draw so let's save this and call this draw. [0:10:20]
 Import shapes and we want the box. Select that, import and we want the handle so we'll [0:10:34]
 import that as well and click on the handle and import that. So we've got this one mobile [0:10:45]
 and select the circle and this circle and I'm going to come in and select the inside circle. [0:10:54]
 So this one here so make sure we get that circle. Got the circle and circle constraints. [0:10:59]
 Add that constraint. If it's around the wrong way then we can use flipped direction. That's [0:11:04]
 around the right way and we'll set that. So we have our draw now and we can save that. [0:11:12]
 So we have two subassemblies in here or we have a subassembly and our main assembly. [0:11:22]
 So I can come in to thechester assembly and come up to a two plus and add a part from external [0:11:32]
 file. Click the draw and our draw comes in. So we've got our draw here with this draw [0:11:44]
 I can strain say this edge against the inside edge. This one in here. I zoom right in because [0:11:54]
 it makes it easier to select and use the axis constraint and we'll set that so that's in there. [0:12:03]
 And we'll move that right click transform or we'll just use the move icon from here. [0:12:10]
 Move selected part. Move that out and we'll also do this side as well. So take this edge [0:12:17]
 and the edge within here. Control click that and constrain the axis and set that. Now you [0:12:27]
 notice that it's moved inwards and that's because all the axis is in line with here. So we've got [0:12:33]
 this axis in line with here. So when I move a part onto constraint using the solver, [0:12:41]
 I can now push this in here and we'll just push it in like so. [0:12:48]
 That's had another draw but that's used different constraints this time. [0:12:53]
 It's come out to a two plus and add part from external file again and click the draw and open it up. [0:13:02]
 So we've got the draw here. I'm going to use the plane constraint. So the first one I'm going to pick [0:13:08]
 is this side, this plane here and control click this face here so we've got two planes and what we [0:13:16]
 want to do is make the quinscent into a java. Come up to the constraints and we've got this [0:13:22]
 plane quinscent constraint. I select that and set that plane is now quinscent with the selected [0:13:30]
 plane so these two planes are together, these two faces and we just do the same with the bottom. [0:13:36]
 So this one here and control click this bottom and make the constraint planes quinscent and a set. [0:13:45]
 So that's a much easier constraint to add. We don't have to come in and try to get the edges. [0:13:51]
 And again if we try to move this draw which is under constraint with the move selected part of [0:13:58]
 the constraint it will move in and out. It will also come out the back as well but that's because it's [0:14:04]
 all on the same plane. We just have to be wary of that. So that's it. We've got a subassembly [0:14:11]
 imported into another subassembly. So if you think about it we could create yet another assembly [0:14:20]
 and import this whole lot, this Chester assembly into that as well. So I hope that's giving you [0:14:26]
 quick introduction with subassemblies in the A2 Plus workbench. The first simple is our pull but it's enough [0:14:32]
 to get you started and get those creative juices running. Hope you enjoyed that and I hope to see [0:14:36]
