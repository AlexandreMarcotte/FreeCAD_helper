===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD for Beginners - 40 - Compound Objects - What are they and how to use them. =====
 Hi everyone, welcome to the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning Free [0:00:03]
 Cafe for Beginners where we teach the fundamentals of free CAD, whilst we learn workflows [0:00:08]
 with practical examples. [0:00:10]
 Today we're going to be looking at compound objects, the reason why there is this, how to [0:00:15]
 use them and get an understanding of how to manipulate your scenes and your models with [0:00:21]
 them. [0:00:22]
 So I hope you enjoy this series, I hope you enjoy the channel and let's have a look at these [0:00:25]
 workflows. [0:00:27]
 If you like what you're seeing and what's donated to the channel then you can do [0:00:29]

 coffee via kho-hifinf.com for slash mang. [0:00:43]
 I'll also run a Patreon week and get early access and additional content and that's at [0:00:47]
 patreon.com for slash mango jelly solutions. [0:00:51]
 Links can be found in the channel header, on the about page or in the descriptions of [0:00:56]
 these videos. [0:00:57]
 So what are compound objects? [0:00:59]
 If you use the part workbench you would have seen the tools in the toolbar just here, [0:01:05]
 make compound and a slow compound which also valuable from the part compound and then this [0:01:12]
 submenu here. [0:01:14]
 A compound object is just that. [0:01:17]
 It's an object made up of a number of different other objects. [0:01:22]
 So I've just added the cube, sender and the sphere says screen and take those and create [0:01:31]
 a compound object out of them. [0:01:33]
 Make compound. [0:01:35]
 This differs from a fusion because we look at these two faces. [0:01:40]
 There's no edge between them. [0:01:42]
 This is because there's still for a row over the compound and zoom out of it. [0:01:47]
 They are still free separate objects. [0:01:50]
 If I click the compound and use the fusion or the union then we get that edge between [0:01:57]
 the two. [0:01:58]
 So you can see that edge there and also you can see an edge in between here and on the other [0:02:03]
 side. [0:02:04]
 So for hover over this now you can see that they are fused together. [0:02:11]
 If we look internally the internal faces have been removed. [0:02:17]
 So you can see that there. [0:02:21]
 I'm just going to hit controls there and hover over that gain and you can see the internal [0:02:29]
 faces are still there. [0:02:31]
 So that's a difference between a compound object and a fusion. [0:02:36]
 A compound object is just a collection of objects. [0:02:38]
 But why are they there and how can we use them? [0:02:44]
 One compound objects aren't just in the prutive objects. [0:02:48]
 They're not just a collection of the screws or primitive objects. [0:02:52]
 They can be creative from a sketch as well and this is where things get interested. [0:02:58]
 So we're going to sketch in here and say a new sketch along the xy plane and I create [0:03:04]
 two objects in here. [0:03:05]
 I'll close geometry and that's create another one. [0:03:13]
 So we've got three objects in here, two slots and a square. [0:03:18]
 If I tell you that sketch over in the part work edge and a struder then that will be a [0:03:24]
 compound object. [0:03:26]
 So if I've screwed this and hit OK I can screw that as one. [0:03:31]
 This is strud because the individual geometry forgot to part compound and a slow compound [0:03:40]
 inside here these are splot of the mount into individual struts. [0:03:45]
 Not only that if I take those and delete them and delete this strud and bring that [0:03:51]
 sketch by pressing the space bar. [0:03:55]
 I can bespoke the sketch as well. [0:03:58]
 So this sketch forgot to part compound and a slow compound. [0:04:05]
 I get the individual geometry in here. [0:04:08]
 This makes sketch in and assembly from something like a blueprint quite quick. [0:04:15]
 So for instance that's take all of these and delete them and create a new sketch [0:04:24]
 and all in the xy plane. [0:04:29]
 Now I can create a rotate but this time I'm going to use open geometry. [0:04:37]
 We can use closed geometry for one and I'm going to create the basis of a container. [0:04:47]
 Something like this. [0:04:49]
 Hit Escape. [0:04:50]
 So I've got that in there. [0:04:51]
 That's place. [0:04:52]
 It's vertical screen on that and let's say that's place a horizontal constraint on [0:04:57]
 that. [0:04:58]
 So we've got this geometry here. [0:05:03]
 Now for one to say it's time what I can do is add a lid to this. [0:05:08]
 So I can create another sketch of open geometry in here. [0:05:15]
 Like so. [0:05:21]
 I'm not going to constrain it. [0:05:22]
 I'm just going to leave this as it is. [0:05:25]
 If I hit close we've got this sketch in here which can be as we saw clicked on and in [0:05:32]
 the part workbench we can come up to part compound, slow compound and we get two individual [0:05:43]
 sketches of open geometry. [0:05:48]
 But let's take another step. [0:05:49]
 I'll delete that and remove that sketch. [0:05:52]
 This time click on the sketch and use the 2D offset. [0:05:57]
 So create a 2D offset here. [0:05:58]
 Let's change this to skin and bring up the offset. [0:06:03]
 So we can see the offset in there. [0:06:05]
 What's happening in there. [0:06:07]
 Let's fill that offset and hit OK. [0:06:11]
 So we've got this offset in here. [0:06:13]
 If I take that 2D shape and use the revolve and I want to revolve it along the y-axis. [0:06:20]
 So we're rotating the offset along the y-axis if I hit OK. [0:06:25]
 We created a container and we hover over that container. [0:06:29]
 You can see that it has a wall in there. [0:06:32]
 If I click that revolve, cut the part, come down to the compound and explode the compound. [0:06:41]
 We'll end up with two individual parts that we can separate off. [0:06:46]
 So we're going to click the transform and move this out. [0:06:52]
 You can see we've got the lab in there. [0:06:55]
 And you see the sketch and how that's created that revolve. [0:07:01]
 That's OK now. [0:07:04]
 It's also worth remembering that parts of free CAD will create compound objects as well. [0:07:10]
 Screen new document and I'm going to create a sphere. [0:07:15]
 I'll come over to the curves for a bench. [0:07:18]
 This is an addon. [0:07:20]
 We've got to add from tools and addon manager. [0:07:24]
 But with this sphere, I can create so-called niso curves. [0:07:29]
 Click that. [0:07:30]
 We get the isocurs added to this. [0:07:35]
 And the isocurs I can change the number of u and v to what I want. [0:07:42]
 So I've accruched the isocurs. [0:07:44]
 This is a separate object. [0:07:46]
 So I'll get this object here. [0:07:49]
 Which I can take and come over to the part workbench. [0:07:55]
 And explode it. [0:07:57]
 Use the compound and a explode compound. [0:08:01]
 If we look at the exploded isocurs, we have the individual isocurs within. [0:08:08]
 So you can see them all here. [0:08:10]
 If we have the circles that run up as well. [0:08:17]
 What that means I can use those in revolves or sweeps to create certain types of geometry. [0:08:25]
 Let's come over to the sketcher and create something to revolve this around. [0:08:31]
 I don't want it attached. [0:08:34]
 Here I can go along the x y plane. [0:08:41]
 And I'm going to place a line around here. [0:08:45]
 This is going to be my rotation line. [0:08:48]
 So I can rotate these partly around this rotation line. [0:08:53]
 Let's come over to the part workbench and select what I want to rotate. [0:08:59]
 So I'm going to rotate a number of the circles like so. [0:09:08]
 Hit the revolve and I'm going to select the reference as this line. [0:09:15]
 And I'm just going to rotate these around about 20 degrees. [0:09:20]
 So I've rotated those around 20 degrees. [0:09:25]
 And you can see we've got the ISO curve there which I'm going to hide. [0:09:33]
 And we've got this object here. [0:09:38]
 And we can remove some of these revolves. [0:09:42]
 See which one we want. [0:09:46]
 Or we can take them and fusion them together. [0:09:55]
 Another useful compound object or a small slice in tools. [0:09:58]
 So let's say we had something in here. [0:10:01]
 Let's take this here. [0:10:04]
 And I want to slice this into four. [0:10:07]
 We can do that by coming up to the part and create primitive. [0:10:11]
 And I'm going to create a plane and use this as a slice until I'm going to set this [0:10:17]
 to about 20 in length and 20 in width. [0:10:22]
 I can hit create three times. [0:10:24]
 This creates three planes and close that. [0:10:28]
 I can then position these planes using the transform into position. [0:10:35]
 And set them at intervals. [0:10:38]
 We can use the placement for this if we wanted to. [0:10:44]
 So I'm just going to transform them into position. [0:10:53]
 And the final one. [0:11:02]
 And now the imposition I can take each of the planes by contrast letting them create a compound [0:11:09]
 out of them. [0:11:16]
 So we've got this sphere and the compound. [0:11:19]
 If I select this sphere, control it with compound. [0:11:23]
 Kind of part, split and slice a part. [0:11:28]
 I slice this sphere into four. [0:11:31]
 So look at the slated slices coming to here. [0:11:35]
 You can see we have four slices. [0:11:39]
 And we can hide these. [0:11:40]
 We can combine them together. [0:11:41]
 And we can do what we like with them. [0:11:43]
 Let's do this the other way. [0:11:45]
 Hit control z so it goes to the sphere back and the compound. [0:11:49]
 This time I can select the compound as the one I want to keep and control select the [0:11:55]
 sphere. [0:11:57]
 Part, split and slice a part. [0:12:03]
 We've now got the sphere as individual slices as per that compound. [0:12:13]
 And also we got the inner slice and the outer slice. [0:12:18]
 So we've got a choice of what we want to use. [0:12:24]
 So we look at the part design. [0:12:25]
 We can't have multi-body objects in there. [0:12:28]
 A compound is a multi-body object. [0:12:30]
 The part design will automatically fuse and cut depending on the feature that's been used. [0:12:36]
 So if we had a padding there or fuse, if we have a revolving there, it will also do [0:12:40]
 the fuse. [0:12:41]
 But if we have something like a pocket or attractive loft, then it's doing a cutting [0:12:46]
 there. [0:12:47]
 It's that individual phase of the automatic cut, fusion or intersection that will [0:12:52]
 break down that workflow. [0:12:53]
 The part workbench is capable of doing those workflows. [0:12:57]
 Part workbench is also capable of creating and modifying non-manifold objects. [0:13:03]
 So I hope that's helped with explaining what compound object is. [0:13:06]
 How can make them and how we can use them. [0:13:08]
 Thanks a lot for watching. [0:13:09]
