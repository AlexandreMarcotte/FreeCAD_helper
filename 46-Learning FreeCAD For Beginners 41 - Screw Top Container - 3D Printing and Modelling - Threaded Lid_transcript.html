===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD For Beginners 41 - Screw Top Container - 3D Printing and Modelling - Threaded Lid =====
 Hi everyone and welcome to the channel and welcome to another episode of Learning Freecap [0:00:03]
 of Beginners teaching the fundamentals of freecap whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:07]
 Today we're looking at a compound workflow to create a Freddie container with lid. [0:00:13]
 So we're going to be following on from previous video. [0:00:15]
 We looked at compound workflows before. [0:00:17]
 We understood what they were and we created a container in there. [0:00:21]
 But in this workflow we're going to be using a practical example and also going to be [0:00:25]
 creating a freely printed output of this to show how effective this workflow is. [0:00:29]
 So I hope you enjoy this channel and let's have a look at this technique. [0:00:32]

 So I've already started a new document in freecap ad on arm in the part workbench. [0:01:07]
 We're going to be using a compound workflow. We don't have to use this workflow. [0:01:12]
 But it's nice to follow on from our previous lesson in the Learning Freecap series where we [0:01:17]
 learn about compounds. So I'm going to show you a compound sketch in how to use that in this [0:01:22]
 workflow. We're going to be sketching one side for a full profile using the revolve to create [0:01:30]
 the final shape. For this I need to come over to the sketch and start sketching a single sketch. [0:01:34]
 We're looking at a long the x-set plane so I'm creating a sketch, long the x-set plane and here [0:01:42]
 okay. This is the rotation point. So we're going to half what we're looking at, half the container [0:01:49]
 and sketch one side left hand side in here and rotate it around here. I've got the all two [0:01:55]
 remove redundant constraints, all to constraints and avoid redundant all to constraints all checked. [0:02:01]
 And we're going to use the polyline this one here. I'm going to start with the lid. [0:02:08]
 So we'll come across and basically make an L shape. So we're going to do to start with [0:02:17]
 sucking the sets and dimensions in here with a length. So of 28mm and now we're looking at the [0:02:25]
 lid height. So this is going to be a little bit, set height of 12mm. [0:02:31]
 Now we've got the basic dimensions in this means we can center ourselves and decide what is going [0:02:39]
 to go. So we can set up our few points so I want to sketch something like this. So zoomed into the [0:02:44]
 correct scale. That's used the polyline again and because we cut the alter constraints on, [0:02:50]
 if I hover over that we get a quince and good strength and we're going to come out and create [0:02:55]
 piece of all geometry and we're going to close the sketch. I'm going to hit a scape and I'm going [0:03:02]
 to clean up my constraints because this point is on that line voice on the vertical so that's fine. [0:03:08]
 So I'm going to set some height in here. This is going to be the width of the wall. [0:03:12]
 So we're going to set that, let's make sure we select this length here because I selected a vertex [0:03:20]
 and a edge which wasn't any good. So that's a 3mm and we'll make these two equal. [0:03:30]
 So we've got this here. We've got the length, we've got a height and we can now set [0:03:41]
 the height of our container with the lid so I'm going to set this point and this point [0:03:46]
 and set a height in here. This will for the constraint this sketch and I'll set this to 16mm. [0:03:53]
 So we have our lid. Now with sketching and we can come out of this creating new sketch for our body. [0:04:02]
 I'm going to stay in the same sketch. So I'm using a single sketch workflow for this and this is where [0:04:10]
 the compound sketch comes in and the compound in our objects. [0:04:13]
 So this can create quite a quick workflow. Next we're going to work on the container. So again [0:04:21]
 I'm going to use the polyline and I'm going to think about where the container will sit. So as this [0:04:27]
 screws onto the container where it will sit. So also we need to come in here and release and [0:04:32]
 remove the thread in. So we can come in and come across and down. We'll wait down connecting [0:04:41]
 up to this line here. Making sure we have the vertical constraint we can add in afterwards. [0:04:46]
 Come across and attach up to that centre point, quiz and constraint and we'll make the wall [0:04:52]
 so come across and back up. Now at this point I'm going to do something slightly different. [0:04:59]
 I'm going to come across an angle to come right across at an angle like so. And then come up [0:05:07]
 and finally connect up with this point, quiz and constraint. Why don't I do this? Well this allows [0:05:14]
 me to free-d print this without the user supports. So I can set this as a row from angle [0:05:23]
 to angle. To allow me to get this into shape. So it allows me to print from the top. [0:05:30]
 Well from the bottom upwards. Let's get some dimensions in here so I'm going to take this line [0:05:40]
 and this line and make the me equal. So look at this from the front so you can see how this is [0:05:47]
 starting to work its way out now. I'm going to make sure that these two points are in line. [0:05:53]
 Place the nose in line there. And I may play so these two points in line. [0:06:02]
 Place those in line and we can put some tolerance in here so I want a little bit of a gap so [0:06:12]
 this point on this point. I'm placing gap in in here of 0.5 mm and are the same from these two. [0:06:23]
 So this point on this point height in here of 0.5. So that keeps these two sketches. [0:06:34]
 Well these two pieces of geometry separate. So we've got this tolerance in here. [0:06:38]
 This can still move in and out and this is where we place a length between these two points. [0:06:47]
 Use a length and this is going to be our fret. So I'm going to put 1.5 mm in that. Our fret is [0:06:54]
 going to live in here. As finished the model we need to set some distance here. [0:07:06]
 And I'm going to keep those the same. So take this one and this one. Make those equal. [0:07:13]
 Three millimeters. And we need to set some work for as well. [0:07:18]
 To do that I'm going to take the three millimeters between here. So this is three millimeters. [0:07:27]
 And take these two points and keep them in line. And finally we can adjust this to the right angle. [0:07:34]
 That we know that's safe for free to print it. [0:07:37]
 Let's place a height in there. [0:07:40]
 A 40 mm. So what we've got is we have two sets of geometry. So we've got this set here. [0:07:53]
 And this set. So two pieces of geometry in here. If I close this you can see much more clearly here. [0:08:00]
 So if I click on the front here's the geometry we've in here. I save this. [0:08:05]
 I'm going to compound container. [0:08:11]
 Now here I have a choice. I can create enough sketch in here for the fret in. Or could [0:08:21]
 add it to the same sketch. That's add it to the same sketch. So I'm going to come into here and just [0:08:27]
 zoom in. And we're looking at this gap within here. So I'm going to quickly add something in here [0:08:32]
 with the polyline and show you the what happens for the workflow. [0:08:37]
 I'm going to add this shape here. So we've got a triangle using the polyline. And I've embedded [0:08:50]
 this into this path of the wall. So I've embedded it into the lid and it protrudes out in the [0:08:56]
 void between the lid and the wall of our container. That's it. It's great to get a [0:09:02]
 last one back and place some horizontal constraint. Let's make sure that these two are in line [0:09:09]
 vertical constraint. And we'll also make these two equal with each other. [0:09:19]
 We'll call it either. So we've got that there. Now the reasons why these embed into this side [0:09:28]
 it means when I go to sweep this along a helix means it has a great connection with the lid. [0:09:35]
 Without causing problems when we're using these together. Let's take these two points. [0:09:40]
 It's points and this line we can multi-slip points and make those two points connected. [0:09:48]
 We're a point on line constraint or point object constraint. We have this line here. You can see [0:09:53]
 I've got redundant constraint which I can click on. Number 59 and hit delete. [0:09:59]
 So we've got that one there. I set this length with the length constraint to 1.5 millimeters. [0:10:15]
 So this is the start of our thread. So we've got that one there. [0:10:22]
 I'll also take this line and this line and create an angle between those. Now the angle's going [0:10:32]
 this way. So that's cancel that and doing an angle between this one and this one. So I really want [0:10:37]
 it going this way. It's made it a bit easier on the eye and we'll set that to 60 degrees. [0:10:44]
 So we've got this here. We've got some length going into here which is fine. [0:10:51]
 And we can set the length up. Just need enough to penetrate the lid. And so that's 0.5 [0:10:59]
 and we've got this one in here already to go. So this is the start of our thread. [0:11:06]
 I'm going to do the same on this side as well. Now could you symmetry to create a symmetric part of this [0:11:12]
 but I'm just going to sketch this in because it's quite an easy sketch. [0:11:16]
 I'll use the polyline and add the sketch in here. So we're going to connect up to this line here [0:11:23]
 and come in. So it's slightly different way of doing that. Connect up and then connect up to this point. [0:11:31]
 And then I'm going to make this one on this one equal. [0:11:38]
 Make these two and this one equal. [0:11:45]
 So we've got this now. I want to do is just make the ends equal as well. [0:11:55]
 So we've got our two shapes here. And I'm going to come down and I make this point and this point. [0:12:02]
 So these two points in here in line with each other. So we have our profile. [0:12:09]
 Now a characteristic of a screw top lid is that the thread in itself is not like normal [0:12:17]
 screw. They don't have as many turns. We don't need as many turns and also they don't go all [0:12:22]
 way to the base. Because if you think about if we have a screw thread in here, then if we don't go [0:12:28]
 all the way to the base, it makes it easy to put the lid on rather than try to find the screw thread [0:12:33]
 at the base. Also it doesn't go all the way to the top either. So the top here. We want to have the [0:12:40]
 lid move freely over this thread and make a seal at this point here. So this will seal down. [0:12:47]
 So we can keep on screwing this up and tightening it and having these pressed together to make [0:12:52]
 a nice seal. So we mustn't stop the thread at the top or the bottom. Also we just need a [0:12:58]
 couple of turns in there. So if I wanted to do it can come in and set some height between these two. [0:13:03]
 For about a millimeter and we have our thread profile in there ready to go. Now it's all done in one [0:13:16]
 sketch. If I close we can see that we got the fret profile, the lid and the container. Now the thing [0:13:26]
 that I've got concerned about is the length between these two. So when I make sure they don't fuse [0:13:31]
 together if we're freely printed. So this gap in here. So I'm going to come in and add a point [0:13:36]
 on here like so. Here it's going. Take these two. Keep them in line. And then I can take these two. [0:13:49]
 I'm putting measurement in here length and create a reference. So reference measurement. [0:13:57]
 So straight away I see that well I don't have enough gapage here. So what I'm going to do is [0:14:04]
 look for this constraint. So I put a horizontal constraint across here number 76. Click on that [0:14:10]
 and delete it. Now I can take this and set this to something like 0.3. Make sure the reference is [0:14:19]
 unchecked and hit OK. That gives a gap in there. So we can set out the gap. [0:14:25]
 Nothing that I want to do is create some curvature in here because if these come to a point [0:14:32]
 then we got a chance of this being quite sharp and also a weakness point it could break off. [0:14:39]
 So I need to create a fillet in here. And I'm going to do this in the sketcher. I'm going to use [0:14:44]
 the fillet until but I'm going to use the constraint preserve in sketch fillet. This will preserve [0:14:53]
 the sketch constraint that's in here. And it does it by taking that fillet this off. So I'm going [0:15:00]
 to click one side and click the other. I'll create a fillet between those two. [0:15:03]
 Lines will protrude to this point and meet up and this is the point where we got the constraint. [0:15:12]
 And that constraints kept. So we got this curvature in here. And I can set say these two points. [0:15:21]
 I'm going to make sure they're in line and set say a radius on here. [0:15:28]
 And we'll set a radius for this one. So there's to 0.25. So there's something like this. [0:15:42]
 So now we're going to have a constraint in here. We need to add the constraint over this side as [0:15:48]
 well. So we need to fillet this and constrain it. That's coming to the constraint preserve and [0:15:54]
 sketch fillet. Add that in. Make these two equal. And looking at this, we'll we've lost some [0:16:09]
 constraints in here. So let's control that that. Make these two equal. [0:16:15]
 And these two have to be equal as well. So we're all in constraint. That's it, close. [0:16:27]
 So we have our sketch. So we have our finished sketch which has multiple closed [0:16:37]
 geometry in here. Now this is a compound. So if I come over to the part and we click on the sketch [0:16:45]
 and come up to part compound, a slow compound, each of those closed geometry will be exploded out [0:16:54]
 into separate sketch parts. So we have this one here which is the profile which is the container profile [0:17:04]
 for our thread and the other one which is the lid profile for the thread. So lid [0:17:15]
 profile. We also got lid. And we've got the container. So these are all profiles which I'm [0:17:34]
 going to use in either a sweep or a revolve. First of all that's revolve both the lid profile [0:17:42]
 and the container profile. Controls that both of those and use the part. [0:17:47]
 Come down to revolve or select it from the toolbar here. Revolving along the z axis [0:17:55]
 and hit OK, the full 360. So now we've got two revolves for the lid. [0:18:01]
 And also the container. Now we've got both of these. That's hide the container. [0:18:18]
 We can see how these profiles line up. So we can see the lid profile here. That's hide this one [0:18:25]
 present in spacebar. And now we've got to make the thread in here. To do that I'm going to use a [0:18:32]
 helix. So let's come up to the view and we'll toggle the axis cross so we can see how that's centered. [0:18:40]
 Let's come up to the part and create the helix from the create primitives. In here we can select [0:18:47]
 from the drop down the helix. Now the helix got a pitch height and radius. So I'm going to set [0:18:55]
 this for the time being to 28 millimeters. So this was the radius of our container itself. [0:19:01]
 The pitch I'm going to set double this length here, which was 1.5. So this is going to [0:19:11]
 three three millimeters and we're going to hit create and then hit close. At the moment this [0:19:20]
 only goes round part the way. So we're going to set the height, press the up arrow until this [0:19:28]
 comes around and basically gives us a cross over here because we don't want too many threads. [0:19:33]
 Otherwise we'll be continuously trying to answer that lid to get to the content. We want this [0:19:38]
 basically a few turns and to get inside. So now I've got that. That's transform this helix. I'm [0:19:48]
 going to hide the lid, press the space bar and I'm going to transform this up. Right click, [0:19:56]
 transform and move this up so it looks like it's intersectioning that profile there. Let's hit okay. [0:20:04]
 Let's look at from the side and look at the center. So centering everything on screen [0:20:12]
 the fill and now we can look at this. Click on the helix and just use some placement to get [0:20:20]
 into position so I'm going to use a position along the z axis and just move this up roughly into position. [0:20:26]
 Doesn't have to be as that. We're using the same helix each time. So our threads will be [0:20:34]
 consistent on both sides. Now we've got the helix. Let's come over the part workbench and use the [0:20:41]
 lid profile. Use the sweep or part sweep. So now we'll sweep. We need to flat the lid profile. [0:20:51]
 So let's make sure we get the right profile. Lid fret profile. Make sure that's let it. [0:20:55]
 Click on the sweep path and click on the path and then click done. Now we need to slap this [0:21:05]
 cratesolid but if we forget and hit okay it sweeps. We can always slap the sweep and set the [0:21:12]
 solid for this. So come down to the solid and moment's force. I said that's true. So we've got the sweep [0:21:19]
 for the lid but we're going to see a bit of a problem here and let's bring back the lid revolve [0:21:24]
 and have a look and you can see that well we've got no leading or lead out to this fret. [0:21:32]
 So how do we go about solving the leading and lead out of this thread to make it easier to connect [0:21:39]
 the lid to the container? It's actually quite simple. I'm going to hide the lid for Christmas [0:21:45]
 base bar and hide our sweep. Press the space around that. We've got the helix. I'm going to come over [0:21:53]
 to the sketcher and click on this point here. So this vertex of the helix. I'm going to slap it [0:22:01]
 and I'm going to create a new sketch. The sketch attachment will be selected to translate [0:22:08]
 in the drop down. If we okay that's so now we've been placed in the center of the sketch [0:22:14]
 with point of the helix at the point of origin. We need to create the lid in and lead out and it's [0:22:21]
 simply a case with this one or creating a line that connects up to this point and comes out. [0:22:28]
 Some distance like so. So if I close that we can see that sketch there. If I bring back the lid [0:22:39]
 revolve you can see that if we follow this revolve you'll be embedded inside this edge here. [0:22:49]
 So we look at the helix. It's the sweep of that helix. Press the space around that. [0:22:53]
 If we follow this forwards in the straight line you'll get embedded into this lid. [0:22:59]
 So let's do the same on the other side. What we must remember also with a sketch is that we [0:23:05]
 mustn't go too far. Otherwise we can come out the other side. We can just shorten this sketch. [0:23:09]
 Click on the lid, hide it and click on the sweep. Press the space outside that as well. [0:23:16]
 That's find the other end of the helix and select vertex. [0:23:22]
 Create a sketch, translate and we'll follow the helix around to this point and create a straight line. [0:23:34]
 Go in this way. Now we've got the straight lines in there. That's close that. [0:23:41]
 And connect these up as one single wire. To do that as close to the part where bench and select the sketch. [0:23:52]
 Follow by the helix then follow by the sketch. [0:23:56]
 We do the new an order just in case we hit problems. We're going to use the connect. [0:24:03]
 So in this drop down here we have a connect objects. This is also available from the part menu. [0:24:08]
 Join and connect objects. You'll normally see the connect objects here. But if it's something [0:24:16]
 else, one of these, then we just change it over. We created a single wire in here, single connect. [0:24:24]
 There's actually compound. So we have to wires inside a compound object and we can see those [0:24:29]
 in there. Now we've got those. That's crank our sweep. [0:24:36]
 Let's come over to the left hand side and look for the sweep. So we've got the profiles, [0:24:43]
 little profile here, little red profile. We've got the sweep. At the moment, it's still using the helix. [0:24:50]
 So we need to swap that out. Click the sweep. Come down and you're find the spine and the moment's [0:24:59]
 helix. Click on that. Click on the button on the end and hit clear and select the new connect object. [0:25:08]
 Once selected, it okay and click off. What you'll see is freecat will recompute and add those onto [0:25:17]
 there. But we see that there's a bit of a problem. If we look, you can see we've got this kind of [0:25:23]
 folded face here. This is not a problem or we have to do as come over to the original sweep [0:25:29]
 and look down and look at our transition. The moment's right corner, that's dropped this down [0:25:36]
 and try round and corner. And click off. We've now got a better connection between those. [0:25:46]
 So you can see how that's connected. Much cleaner there. And if we come back over, let's change that [0:25:58]
 back through right corner and we can see the difference. You can see we've got a folding in there. [0:26:05]
 It's weep, right corner. Also got transformed as well. And if we look at that, that's even better. [0:26:15]
 So we can juggle between those and decide which one gives us the better transition [0:26:24]
 between those two edges of that connect. That's bring about the lid, the lid revolve. [0:26:33]
 And we're looking good inside and we can see that sweep follows it all way in to the lid. [0:26:41]
 Now we're going to the point where we can merge these two together in a fusion. [0:26:46]
 Click the lid and I've control sweep from the tree view or we can control static from the screen. [0:26:55]
 I can't part, Boolean and Newton. Also available from the tool. [0:27:03]
 So let's see your fusion is just failed. So let's cover that scenario. If that's the case, [0:27:09]
 I'm just going to delete this fusion. Then it may be worth creating the sweep in a slightly [0:27:15]
 different way. We still use the sketches and the helix and the other sketch. This is a hide [0:27:25]
 the lid and also hide the sweep and we'll swap that out in a minute. [0:27:32]
 The first thing to do would be to come in to the sketch and rather than the new straight lines, [0:27:40]
 is to use a endpoint and endpoint arc. Therefore we can get some continuity between this edge. [0:27:52]
 I make this less of a straight line coming out. So it's worth doing that and we can do that on both [0:27:59]
 sides. You can see the sweep is fine now. So let's sketch one to do as well. Let's take away that [0:28:06]
 straight line to delete that and create the arc in here. We've continuity to this edge. [0:28:16]
 So create a tangent constraint on this arc and this axis we've tangent see and close that. [0:28:27]
 We may need to change this one slightly and bring this out. [0:28:35]
 So look at my sweep that should have changed. So we've got an arc in here now. We just have a look to [0:28:46]
 make sure this is okay and have a look at the lid to revolve. So we've got those. So that's one [0:28:52]
 white and we check the fusion so the sweep can drop a little lid and make a fusion. [0:29:02]
 So you can see those are failed. So that one's failed now. So we've got to that scenario. [0:29:08]
 So that's fixed that. If that's failing we can make use the same called the curse workbench to [0:29:14]
 connect those together as one single line. So at the moment we've got that connecting there [0:29:20]
 that we're using. This time I'm going to come over to the curse workbench. [0:29:24]
 This is an external workbench so you'll need to come to tools and add on mandra [0:29:29]
 and search for the curse workbench in here. The click on filters and just typing curves [0:29:36]
 and you'll find the curse workbench here not curse shapes the curse workbench. [0:29:41]
 If we install that we can come over to the curse workbench and there's something called a join curve in here. [0:29:47]
 So this will allow us to join those curves and make continuity gains them. [0:29:52]
 So that's coming to the connect. We're going to hide the lid and hide that sweep. So that sweep [0:30:02]
 there. Just hide it and connect up these edges. So I'm going to click on one [0:30:10]
 Ctrl click on the other and click on this one and then make the join curve. So we come [0:30:17]
 out to the join curve icon or the curves and come down to the join curves. Don't select the [0:30:26]
 sketch helix and the other sketch from the left hand side here using the tree view because we'll [0:30:31]
 get three separate join curves. Now they've been applied. We get this purple edge that goes around here. [0:30:37]
 This is a single edge, single curve. Click on those for press the space bar. You can see that there. [0:30:43]
 All we can do now is bring about the sweep. Come down to the spine. We're going to go connect. [0:30:50]
 That's the join curve this time. Just un-slat the connect. Just let join curve and here. Okay. [0:30:57]
 The sweep has got tick by means it needs reconputing. [0:31:01]
 Edit, refresh and the sweep has taken. So you can see the sweep has taken. [0:31:09]
 Notice what's different. We've got no edges here now. We've got a nice clean sweep. [0:31:15]
 So now our connect has been separated. We don't need this connect anymore so we can delete that. [0:31:24]
 And you can see that join curve is in the here. The helix has been released and the sketch [0:31:30]
 and sketch two have been released. And we should just go that join curve. [0:31:34]
 That connects up all those edges. Two. [0:31:38]
 Sketch two edge one. Helix and the other sketch edge one. [0:31:43]
 And now we can come back to the part where don't. [0:31:49]
 Bring back the lid revolve. [0:31:55]
 And let the lid control slap the sweep and do the fusion. [0:32:04]
 And we've got our fusion that's taken in there and you can see we've got [0:32:10]
 single edges for rather than it be separated here with another edge. [0:32:15]
 We need to do the same with the container. So we're going to hide that fusion [0:32:23]
 and we need to hide the sketches. [0:32:27]
 And also inside that fusion we've also got the sweep and we can see that the join curve is still visible. [0:32:36]
 Now the helix we still need to keep visible because we're going to do the same on the container. [0:32:43]
 We need to make some modifications to this. Our container if we look up container rough or space bump. [0:32:49]
 We need to get the profile for that container thread. So we've got container thread profile there. [0:32:59]
 That's the space part. So it's in there. [0:33:02]
 So we need to make some amendments to our helix because if we do the sweep with these profiles, [0:33:13]
 let's do that now. Let's do the sweep to show you this quick sweep. [0:33:17]
 We need the container thread profile. Pop-click that and we need the helix which is going around the [0:33:26]
 outside. That's the path. So sweep path. Let the helix hit done. Make sure it's a solid [0:33:36]
 croissant and here. Okay. So you can see that helix is going around there but we need the [0:33:43]
 leading and lead out. So to do that that's hide the container. [0:33:51]
 We're going to select this point. We're going over to the sketcher. [0:34:00]
 This has got to curve inwards. So this has got to go inwards now and it's the same routine. [0:34:10]
 Select the vertex, create a sketch, translate. Okay. [0:34:16]
 Create our endpoint and endpoint arc. We're arching inwards from this point. [0:34:25]
 Great. A tendency can strain our case here if you want. [0:34:30]
 And create some arc that goes inwards. That's close that and the same on this side. [0:34:38]
 This helix here. That vertex, use sketch, translate. Okay. And create the arc. That goes inwards. [0:34:46]
 And tangency across those. [0:34:52]
 And close. So we've got those now. We can use the connect but I'm going to come over to the [0:35:05]
 cursor workbench game and select the first sketch, the helix, the last sketch. [0:35:12]
 And create the join with the join curves. The helix and the sketches are selected at the moment. [0:35:21]
 It's press the spacebar, hide them. And now the sweep. This one here, we can replace the spine. [0:35:32]
 So the spine here is the helix. Click in there. Click clear and find how to join curve. [0:35:39]
 The new join curve, the loss one in the list and here. Okay. [0:35:42]
 The sweep was selected as recompute and that's travelled inwards. Now, so you can see those [0:35:52]
 travelling inwards. If we have a problem and you'll see that as a file sweep, [0:36:01]
 then it's worth coming to the sweep and set the solid as force. [0:36:06]
 And what happened if we click off, you might see some odd shaping with this sweep. [0:36:17]
 If that happens, it's just to do with the sketch placement. So, one of the [0:36:22]
 four sets to do it. Let's try to force it to do it. [0:36:26]
 It's not going to do it. So if it does, we just need to move our sweep. [0:36:36]
 So those sketches fall that sweep and we just need to position them properly. [0:36:43]
 I don't think it's going to do it. But we can play with sketches to get the right effect that we want. [0:36:55]
 So I'm going to come over to about here and close that. And you see it's not solid. [0:37:03]
 As you can see inside that, as to the other one, I'm bringing this over here and close that. [0:37:15]
 Once I'm happy, make sure the sweep is set to solid as true. [0:37:23]
 And then we can come into our container. If we come down and find the container, I was at the top. [0:37:32]
 There is a container revolve. You can see how that's going to go into there. [0:37:36]
 I made some adjustments on this side. [0:37:38]
 Select the container, control, slap, sweep. [0:37:43]
 I'll be in the part where I'll match for this. So we set that the container, control, slap, sweep, [0:37:50]
 and create the fusion. And those are fused together. [0:37:56]
 We can hide the joint curve. And now we're ready to freely print this. [0:38:05]
 So to freely print, we'll we need to export this out. Let's come over to that fusion just for [0:38:12]
 rename that as container. And the other fusion. Right click, rename as lid. [0:38:22]
 I'm going to create a link copy. That gives me the choice of how I want to freely print this. [0:38:31]
 So if I create a link copy with the container and a link copy with the lid using this link tool at the top, [0:38:39]
 link link. That means that I can use these. Transform and rotate them wherever I want without affecting [0:38:48]
 the main container. So the main container is here. And if I click on link copy right click transform, [0:38:56]
 you'll notice that I can move this aside. It's like a column. Basically. So that's hide the container. [0:39:06]
 That's hide the lid. For instance, spacebar on those. We've got our lid here and the container. [0:39:12]
 Click on the container. I can use the placement. I'm just going to set this back to the position of [0:39:18]
 zero. And I'm going to take the lid right click transform and just flip it around this way. [0:39:27]
 And bring it up. And over to the side. [0:39:37]
 So we've got these two. This gives us an idea of what these look like. We can look over them. [0:39:50]
 Rotate them around see if we've got any problem for them. For instance, I can come around and [0:39:56]
 have a look. Just make sure everything's okay. I can play with this lid. I can put it on top. [0:40:04]
 I can twist it around. See where it's placed. It's just nice to see both side by side. [0:40:09]
 And gives you a way of assembling them. And placing them on the screen so we can get an overview [0:40:15]
 of what we're looking at. The link copy can be exported to their steel. [0:40:19]
 If I line up the bases of these two, then we could export this as one object. [0:40:26]
 I can control clicking them. And go out to file export. [0:40:32]
 But I want to export these out at separate objects. So I can click on the container, I got to file [0:40:38]
 and down to export and choose what I want to export this as. So I can export this as STL [0:40:46]
 and export it from here and save that out. The same with the lid. Click on the lid. [0:40:54]
 File, export and export that out as well. [0:41:01]
 So that's how to look how this freely prints. Let's have a look at printing this now. [0:41:09]
 As you can see, I'm printing the lid on its own. And we're going to be using basically just a default [0:41:15]
 settings in there. There's nothing special about this. I'll just let this look defaults. [0:41:19]
 Go for a slice and export it out to the SD card. For the container itself, I reduce the size [0:41:28]
 of it just because I'm running out of PLA. A gain the container is printed with the default [0:41:34]
 settings. Nothing special. And the results come out pretty good. The lid on the container screws [0:41:39]
 up tightly due to where we place the thread. I use something like a 0.5mm tolerance. [0:41:44]
 But I can reduce that down a bit more. I hope you enjoy that video and I hope to see you again in the [0:41:51]
