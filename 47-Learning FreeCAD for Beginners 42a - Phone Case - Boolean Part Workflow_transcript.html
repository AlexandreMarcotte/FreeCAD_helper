===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD for Beginners 42a - Phone Case - Boolean Part Workflow =====
 Hi everyone and welcome to the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning Free [0:00:03]
 Cafe for beginners, we're teaching the fundamentals of free CAD whilst we learn workflows [0:00:08]
 and creating practical examples. [0:00:11]
 Today we're creating a phone case. [0:00:13]
 Now there are two videos. [0:00:15]
 This video is for the part workflow. [0:00:18]
 There is another video that you can find in the description or you can look on my channel [0:00:22]
 and that's for the part design workflow. [0:00:24]
 So I've released these as two separate videos and you'll be able to choose one over the [0:00:29]
 other. [0:00:30]
 Very simple workflows, they're just taken from the part and part design aspect. [0:00:34]
 So we're going to be creating this simple phone case in the part workflow for this one. [0:00:40]
 So I hope you enjoy this series and that's how we look at this workflow. [0:00:45]

 videos. [0:01:16]
 So we're in free CAD, we started a new document and I'm going to go over to the sketch [0:01:23]
 app. [0:01:24]
 So we're using a part workflow for this. [0:01:26]
 If you want to use a part design workflow then check out the other video that's uploaded [0:01:30]
 alongside this and you'll find that on my channel. [0:01:32]
 I'll leave a link in the description below. [0:01:34]
 For this I'm in the sketch and I'm creating a new sketch. [0:01:37]
 We're going to be looking on the xy plane. [0:01:40]
 What we're going to do is create this phone itself and remove that from some material. [0:01:46]
 Now when I say create the phone itself it's going to be a very simple phone so we could [0:01:50]
 use say the primitive tools over the part where bench or we could just use a simple sketch. [0:01:57]
 I'm going to come up to the rounded rectangle so the rounded rectangle here and we're going [0:02:03]
 to create the rectangle. [0:02:06]
 So this is for the phone. [0:02:08]
 We could create say a normal rectangle and fill it off the edges for the fillet tool. [0:02:15]
 This one here and that's the same as creating this rounded rectangle here. [0:02:21]
 You can go for rounded rectangle and we'll make it symmetrical to this point. [0:02:29]
 Taking these two points and this point make it symmetrical. [0:02:34]
 I'm going to put some distance between these two points here so add some height. [0:02:39]
 Now this is the height of my phone which is 160mm. [0:02:47]
 And also we need to add some width. [0:02:50]
 Take these two and place it in a width of 73mm. [0:02:58]
 We've got our basic phone shape and we can add the curvature here if we wanted to this [0:03:08]
 curvature here and this depends what curvature we have on the phone. [0:03:12]
 I'm going to go for that. [0:03:14]
 So these are the edges of the phone and place a radius across that. [0:03:21]
 Let's say 7mm for my... [0:03:25]
 This is all what you really need for the sketch. [0:03:28]
 That's closed that. [0:03:29]
 So I've got the shape here. [0:03:32]
 We come over to the sketch and we can come over to the part where I'm going to use the [0:03:36]
 part work pinch flow and using this strewd. [0:03:41]
 Now this is the strewd of the phone so this is the height of the phone so this is going [0:03:45]
 to be 8mm in my case. [0:03:49]
 Next I'm going to add some more for the tin. [0:03:53]
 So my phone flits around here. [0:03:56]
 So I'm going to add some curvature in here. [0:03:58]
 For that I'm going to use the philical and we can select this droid. [0:04:03]
 Use the philical and I'm going to select the faces. [0:04:07]
 So select faces. [0:04:08]
 I'm going to select the top. [0:04:10]
 So you can see all the edges of that face has been selected and we come to the bottom [0:04:15]
 and select that as well. [0:04:17]
 So we've got that there. [0:04:19]
 It's going to be 8mm going across here. [0:04:23]
 So now for that it's got to be something like 3.5 and here. [0:04:30]
 Okay. [0:04:31]
 So there's a fillet there. [0:04:33]
 So if we think about it, 4mm is 1x4mm is the other side. [0:04:38]
 If I was touching that will probably fail. [0:04:41]
 So we use it like 3.9. [0:04:44]
 If I've used that there to create the phone, 3.5. [0:04:48]
 So we've got our phone blank. [0:04:51]
 But we haven't finished yet because what I'm going to do is create. [0:04:55]
 Basically a rectangle around this and remove this from the inside of the rectangle. [0:04:59]
 But to allow our phone to slip inside then I need to extrude this upwards. [0:05:05]
 So I need some extrusion in here. [0:05:07]
 To create the opening to fit our phone it. [0:05:10]
 For that I'm going to select the top face. [0:05:13]
 I'm going to come over to the sketcher. [0:05:16]
 Make sure that top face is selected. [0:05:17]
 We can see it highlighted in green and create a new sketch. [0:05:21]
 That's flat face to it and here. [0:05:23]
 Okay. [0:05:26]
 This is going to be connected up to the phone. [0:05:28]
 So it punches through the top of the case. [0:05:31]
 That's Paulinson geometry. [0:05:33]
 So I'm going to pull in this line and this one. [0:05:38]
 And also the else it ends as well. [0:05:40]
 So we're going to put a rectangle against these. [0:05:43]
 Like so. [0:05:49]
 And I'm going to pick a rounded rectangle to go in here. [0:05:52]
 So using the rounded rectangle going. [0:05:56]
 And we're coming and we're placed round a rectangle in. [0:06:00]
 Place it somewhere for the time being. [0:06:02]
 It's a scape and pull in this point here. [0:06:05]
 So this for that. [0:06:07]
 And that's manipulate this into place. [0:06:09]
 So what I'm trying to do is place. [0:06:13]
 These two points. [0:06:15]
 This point onto here. [0:06:16]
 We point on object constraint. [0:06:18]
 And this point onto here. [0:06:20]
 We have a point on object constraint. [0:06:23]
 When this is a extruded, then it creates the wind. [0:06:29]
 I place our phone through. [0:06:31]
 And also it will take out some of this lip here as well. [0:06:35]
 We'll see this in a moment. [0:06:36]
 That's come down to the other side. [0:06:38]
 And pull this down. [0:06:39]
 Well, that's not used that one. [0:06:40]
 That's used to fill it to pull this down. [0:06:43]
 We can see that, well, as we pull this down, [0:06:45]
 we need to sort the top for that out because it's still on object [0:06:49]
 constraint here. [0:06:50]
 And it's following this line. [0:06:51]
 So I'm going to set some distance in here between these two. [0:06:56]
 Set a distance of 1.75 millimeters. [0:07:01]
 And this one will be the same. [0:07:03]
 So that can't move now. [0:07:04]
 Now we should be able to pull this rectangle out. [0:07:08]
 And you can see that's being pulled out fine now. [0:07:10]
 So we come down to the bottom. [0:07:11]
 I'll zoom out. [0:07:14]
 Zoom out a bit more. [0:07:15]
 And pull this out all the way down to the bottom. [0:07:19]
 And grab that point and pull this down. [0:07:23]
 And again, what we're going to do, which is place it [0:07:30]
 into position around about there, is place this point [0:07:34]
 on this imported geometry point on object constraint [0:07:39]
 and do the same with this one as well. [0:07:42]
 So we've got that one there and I'll take this point [0:07:45]
 on this line. [0:07:47]
 We'll point on object constraint. [0:07:50]
 That's constraint nicely. [0:07:51]
 So we'll constrain up because it's the same radius. [0:07:55]
 We don't have to add in this geometry here. [0:07:59]
 This 1.75 because this radius takes care of the bottom. [0:08:03]
 We just constrain up and there it is. [0:08:06]
 That's it close. [0:08:07]
 So we've got that there. [0:08:10]
 Now we're going to extrude that. [0:08:12]
 That's come over to the part. [0:08:16]
 And we make sure it's sketch is selected. [0:08:19]
 And we're screwed it. [0:08:21]
 Now when we're screwed, we've got to make it symmetric to plane. [0:08:25]
 Because if I extrude this now, 10mm, it's just enough [0:08:29]
 to punch through the top. [0:08:31]
 Might be a bit too much, but that's okay. [0:08:33]
 You can see that we've got some gap in here. [0:08:36]
 So if we remove this from the material, [0:08:39]
 it's going to leave this overhang. [0:08:41]
 So what we do is take this strude and come down to the data. [0:08:47]
 And look at the symmetric and set that to true. [0:08:53]
 If it punches out the bottom, we just reduce this strude. [0:08:57]
 So we can just reduce that strude to say five. [0:09:01]
 Like so. [0:09:04]
 It's just enough to come through the top. [0:09:07]
 So we're building our blank. [0:09:08]
 Now we've got to take the top of strude, control click, the fillet, [0:09:15]
 and use a part, ooling, and union. [0:09:20]
 Those will be union together. [0:09:22]
 So we've got our phone blank. [0:09:25]
 What does this mean? [0:09:26]
 Well, what we can do is come over to the sketchwork edge. [0:09:31]
 The sketcher and select the top face. [0:09:35]
 Great to sketch. [0:09:37]
 Make sure it's flat face and okay. [0:09:41]
 And we're going to create the body of our protector. [0:09:45]
 Now this can be any shape you want. [0:09:48]
 I ain't going to go for a roundy rectangle. [0:09:51]
 Actually, that's just go for a rectangle with this one. [0:09:55]
 So I'm going to place a rectangle in here. [0:09:58]
 And I can decide how far this is away from this one. [0:10:02]
 So first of all, I'm going to take these two points. [0:10:05]
 Make the symmetrical with the center point. [0:10:10]
 Use an symmetry and we're sets in distance. [0:10:15]
 Or something like 90 and a height of 100 and 70. [0:10:26]
 So we've got that there. [0:10:29]
 That's it. [0:10:30]
 Close. [0:10:31]
 Now we need to screw this butt. [0:10:35]
 If we think of this as the case that this is going to be taken away from. [0:10:40]
 So we can cut this away from it. [0:10:43]
 We need to move the sketch down. [0:10:45]
 To take the sketch, look at it. [0:10:47]
 It will be on the attachment. [0:10:49]
 First one in a list position, along the Z axis. [0:10:53]
 So normal to sketch. [0:10:56]
 And we go down, say minus one. [0:11:00]
 I still want one looking for. [0:11:02]
 It's just to intersect the top. [0:11:06]
 Let's do a bit of a little bit of a long here to keep the phone in. [0:11:12]
 So minus 3.2. [0:11:16]
 Now we do. [0:11:19]
 So we've got that there. [0:11:21]
 We could go minus 3 at our places along there. [0:11:24]
 So we've got the stars. [0:11:28]
 I'll see a screwed sketch is at the right place. [0:11:30]
 We take the sketch over in the part workbench and a screwed it. [0:11:36]
 So make sure the sketch is slatted. [0:11:37]
 Slatter's screwed. [0:11:38]
 It will screwed upwards. [0:11:39]
 We need to go downwards. [0:11:43]
 So we change the long to say minus. [0:11:48]
 This is 8 millimeters isn't it. [0:11:50]
 That's go from minus 10 for the time being. [0:11:52]
 That sets it this way. [0:11:54]
 And let's give that a go. [0:11:59]
 So what we've got is an astute and effusion. [0:12:05]
 This fusion, I'll rename that to phone blank. [0:12:14]
 And rename the astute to case. [0:12:19]
 Then you can see what's going to happen. [0:12:21]
 Take the one we want to keep, which is the case. [0:12:24]
 Control-click in the one we want to remove, which is the phone blank. [0:12:28]
 And then come up to part. [0:12:30]
 Boolean and cut. [0:12:33]
 We've removed that from inside there. [0:12:35]
 So you can see it inside. [0:12:37]
 It's been removed. [0:12:39]
 And this is what I was saying about the shape of this. [0:12:42]
 This can be what I've a shape you want. [0:12:44]
 So we can go in and change that sketch to what I've a shape. [0:12:46]
 You can see that we've got the necessary proving here to keep the phone in. [0:12:55]
 Maybe we're making this blank slightly bigger to set the tolerance of off-e-fone, [0:13:01]
 depending on what material you're printing this in. [0:13:05]
 We can finish this up, we have some fillets. [0:13:07]
 Or we could even come in to our case. [0:13:12]
 And look at the sketch. [0:13:16]
 We could fill it off the edges. [0:13:17]
 So that's used a constraint preserving fillet. [0:13:20]
 This will preserve this constraint here as a place to fill it in, like so. [0:13:26]
 We've got one there. [0:13:28]
 Let's place one down the bottom. [0:13:34]
 Let those two. [0:13:39]
 Make the make-all and set the radius. [0:13:43]
 And hit OK. [0:13:47]
 We can do it for the other side, but I'll see what happens. [0:13:49]
 And you can see we've got fillets there. [0:13:53]
 You could do the fillet from here and use the fillet tool if you want. [0:13:57]
 We can use the sketch or that. [0:14:00]
 That's more fillet in. [0:14:08]
 And fill it down the bottom. [0:14:16]
 And then take this one and make those equal. [0:14:25]
 Or we need to make it equal for this one as well. [0:14:27]
 That's like that one, my those equal. [0:14:29]
 So fillet constraint and hit close. [0:14:33]
 So we're starting to get the case. [0:14:37]
 And we can make the alterations that we need here. [0:14:40]
 And say that set this to 85, just bring that in a bit further. [0:14:47]
 And we can start then by adding sketch it on here to create the access ports. [0:14:54]
 Maybe pull that down a bit further so that's set that to 80. [0:15:01]
 Don't think like that. [0:15:05]
 So to create the access ports, we just let the face, [0:15:08]
 well we need to be over the sketcher. [0:15:10]
 And it's just a case. [0:15:12]
 Of creating the features that we need so let's in the bottom face. [0:15:16]
 New sketch, flat face, okay, and create, say, [0:15:20]
 out, pull, pull cut out, take in these two and this line, making the symmetric. [0:15:32]
 And we'll be looking at where these are placed on your phone. [0:15:39]
 To get them in the right position. [0:15:41]
 Because we're in a part where flow, we can take that over the part, [0:15:47]
 a screwed it, and well I haven't selected the sketch yet. [0:15:51]
 So that was our last sketch sketch free. [0:15:54]
 And 10 mil, going the wrong way. [0:15:58]
 I selected the strewed and placed this as minus 10. [0:16:03]
 So that's gone through there. [0:16:06]
 And what we do is literally build up all the features. [0:16:09]
 Let's come back in and say that's place, a circle in here. [0:16:16]
 And one the other side. [0:16:22]
 And place these two, and this one in line, and close up. [0:16:32]
 So we've got those asstrooted through there. [0:16:35]
 I'll just add them to the same sketch as this strewed. [0:16:37]
 And we need something in here. [0:16:40]
 Let's come over to the sketcher. [0:16:42]
 Again, new sketch, flat face, okay. [0:16:47]
 And we can place in a rounded rectangle. [0:16:54]
 Let's just do this quickly. [0:16:55]
 So a round of rectangle in here, like so. [0:16:57]
 Taking these two and this center line, symmetrical. [0:17:02]
 We can sort out what the sizes are later. [0:17:06]
 And we've got that one in there. [0:17:08]
 And we need to come over to the part. [0:17:10]
 Take that sketch, a strewed it's, and this has got a strewed all the way through. [0:17:16]
 So again, I think this is going to be minus [0:17:19]
 Enter. So long as it comes out of the back, and once we've got all those, [0:17:25]
 we can do a Boolean cut with those. [0:17:29]
 The cut to part, Boolean, and Boolean. [0:17:36]
 And then we select which ones we need. [0:17:39]
 So this is where naming them comes in handy. [0:17:43]
 So that's cancel that. So we've got a screwed strewed free and a strewed for. [0:17:47]
 And what we want to do is Boolean them into here with Boolean cut. [0:17:54]
 So at the moment, if I control flat bows and cut part, [0:17:58]
 Boolean and Boolean, then this is not going to get us anywhere because it's requiring [0:18:07]
 two objects only. [0:18:08]
 This strewed is a compound because we create a sketch with multiple bodies in their multiple [0:18:14]
 geometry, multiple closed geometry, and they're created this as a compound. [0:18:19]
 So if that's the case, it's controlled flat, both of those strewed and create those as a compound. [0:18:25]
 Part compound make compound. So they've got a compound of all those features now. [0:18:33]
 So we can add all those features to the phone. [0:18:36]
 And now we can do the Boolean. So select the one that we want to keep. [0:18:41]
 The cut controls like compound, [0:18:44]
 part, Boolean, and cut. That's cut them all as one. [0:18:53]
 So you can see them in there. So that is a very simple sample of how to create a phone case. [0:19:01]
 You notice that, well, because we've cut quite low, we've actually gone into part. [0:19:07]
 The case, you may want this or you may want to come in and move this up a bit. [0:19:12]
 I personally know mine this. This is fine for me, but we just move the sketch out was [0:19:17]
 to allow for more clearance from the bottom. [0:19:20]
 As said, if you want a part design workflow, then check out the other video that I've created for this. [0:19:27]
 Where we basically do the same, but from a part design process. [0:19:31]
 The main difference if the part and part design is that the part design [0:19:36]
 automatically create those Boolean features. So we create a sketch, we've padded it. [0:19:40]
 If we create a pocket on that, it automatically cuts that away. [0:19:44]
 So we don't have to do that Boolean operation. But it requires a slightly different workflow [0:19:49]
 because we have to create bodies in there. So if you want to follow that, that's on my site [0:19:52]
 in the moment. And the link is in the description below. Hope you enjoyed that video. [0:19:57]
