===== START OF VIDEO: Learning FreeCAD for Beginners 42b - Phone Case - Boolean Part Design Workflow =====
 I have one on walk as a channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning Free [0:00:04]
 Cafe for beginners, where we teach the fundamentals of free CAD whilst we learn [0:00:08]
 workflows. Today we're going to be looking at creating a phone case. Now there [0:00:12]
 are two videos to this. There's one video for the part workflow and there's [0:00:17]
 another video that uses a part design workflow. So I've created two videos and it's [0:00:23]
 up to you which one you want to choose. Just gives you the option to take either [0:00:28]
 off. So this one is for the part design workflow and we're going to be creating [0:00:33]
 this phone case in there. We're going to be using pads, pockets and [0:00:39]
 building features for this. So I hope you enjoy the channel and let's have a look at this [0:00:43]
 workflow. If you like we see you want to donate to the channel then you can do [0:00:48]

 So I'm freecat and I'll start new document. This is the part design workflow for the phone case. [0:01:22]
 So we're going to first start by coming over to the part design. [0:01:26]
 We're in the part design. We're going to go to create a body or use the icon for the top [0:01:31]
 and create a sketch. Again we can use the icon for the top. We're going along the x-y plane [0:01:38]
 and here okay. So what we're going to do is create the blank for our phone and remove it from [0:01:45]
 another body. So we're going to use it like a mold. This is just going to be a simple blank. [0:01:52]
 So it's basically it's shape of the phone. I'm going to use a rounded rectangle this one here. [0:01:59]
 We could use num rectangle and say chamfer off the size. We'll fill it off the size with a [0:02:06]
 fillet tool. But I'm going to use the rounded rectangle. [0:02:13]
 And we'll create our rectangle and take these points here. I make this symmetrical to the center. [0:02:27]
 Like so. This means that we can create features like the port symmetrical here and [0:02:38]
 just make our life a lot easier when creating this because the phone has symmetry. [0:02:43]
 Remember this is just a simple shape. Now let's get some height in here. So my phone, [0:02:50]
 height of this is 160mm. The width of these two points is 73mm. So same in fact they [0:03:08]
 can strengthen here. That's okay that. And that's because we need to bring these in a bit. [0:03:13]
 That's all these out. Pull them up. Now we should be able to do this. Take these two points. [0:03:19]
 So at distance of 73mm. So we've got our basic shape of the phone. That's place and radius [0:03:29]
 across here. Let's go for a radius. I'm going to say so mil. So we've got our basic phone shape here. [0:03:38]
 That's close that. With this sketch we'll pad this to the size of the phone. So 8mm. [0:03:47]
 So this is the width of my phone. Now I'm going to add some filleting because my phone [0:03:54]
 isn't this shape. It's got filleted sides. So smooth sides. So I'm going to come in and select [0:04:01]
 the pad. Let's let that top face and come in and add the fillet. So this tool here, the fillet. [0:04:08]
 Also available from part design. It's apply a dress up and add the fillet. At the moment, [0:04:17]
 face 10 has been selected. So that's left to the other faces as well. So click add and click the other [0:04:23]
 face. And now what we can do is set the radius of the fillet. So I'm going to go for something like [0:04:31]
 3.5. So we've got our fillet in there. Let's hit OK. Now we've got the blank of our phone. [0:04:40]
 I'm going to rename that body to blank body. But we haven't quite finished yet. We need to [0:04:53]
 make some piping here. So we need to make another sketch. So we pad it upwards. Allowness to use [0:05:01]
 this with a cut against say a rectangle. If we think about a rectangle in here and we pad this forwards [0:05:09]
 which every way we're going to do this may do the rectangle on top. Then we need a way of opening [0:05:17]
 that right angle to get the phone inside when we create a cut with this object. So I'm going to select [0:05:25]
 the top face and create a sketch. That's going to be matte flat face that sketch. And now I'm [0:05:33]
 going to use again another round of rectangle. And I'm going to place it within here. [0:05:40]
 So that's just bringing in this rectangle and place it somewhere in here for the time being. [0:05:46]
 Now to get this position properly, I'm going to pull in these edges. So this edge and this edge. [0:05:53]
 Pulling those edges, what I can do is take, get a scape. Take this point and this line [0:06:03]
 point on object constraint and do the same with this one as well. This point and this line [0:06:11]
 point on object constraint and I can place them on that line like so and then set the distance between [0:06:22]
 these two of a distance. I'll say 1.75. So that's constraint. You can see the green in there. That's [0:06:30]
 constraint. We do the same down the bottom but because of the radius, that radius won't change because [0:06:39]
 that's a lot. So all we need to do is literally pull this down to the bottom down here. Let's put it [0:06:49]
 in there and zoom in and pull in one of these edges and then again do the same here. Escape, [0:06:59]
 take this point and this edge and a point on object constraint. Let's bring in the average. [0:07:07]
 This one here. Here, escape. Take this point and this edge again point on object constraint. You see how [0:07:17]
 this has locked down and that's because well we've got an equal radius here and because of these [0:07:25]
 a position it's fully constrained our geometry. We have this single constraint, this single [0:07:32]
 that constraint here as it closed. So now we've got our sketch sitting on top of here. We got to move [0:07:40]
 this sketch now to move it downwards because what we want to do is intercept the sketch. [0:07:45]
 On this line here. So now we've got the sketch. We need to pad this. So when we pad this, be careful [0:08:03]
 because if we look from the side we can see we've pad this straight up. We're going to get some gaping [0:08:08]
 in here. We don't want that. So let's click pad on that sketch and click some magical to plane. [0:08:16]
 And then all we have to do is come to length and set that to some length. So about five. We just [0:08:23]
 want this coming out at the top. Do allow us to access the phone. Let's hit OK. And now we've got our [0:08:32]
 pad in there. So we got our phone blank. When this is removed from material, [0:08:36]
 this pad will allow for the access point. And this part, the body, we will allow for the [0:08:46]
 hollow inside to place our phone in there. So now what we want to do is make sure nothing is [0:08:52]
 slatted and create a new body. This body we're going to rename it. Right click. And this is going [0:09:00]
 to be the case body. So we just not rename that to case body. The body is the active body. We can [0:09:09]
 see it active in there. It's in bold. If it's not in bold, we just click on it right click to [0:09:14]
 go to that body. It has to be active because the next procedure is to take this face and create [0:09:24]
 a subject writer. This will allow us to access the geometry inside the case body. So we want to [0:09:31]
 access this geometry on top of here to allow us to place a sketch upon there. To make sure it's [0:09:38]
 slatted, highlighted and green, use the subject binder or part design create a subject shape binder. [0:09:45]
 Binder has been created here. And you can see it sitting on top. Now we've got two options here. [0:09:53]
 We can select the top of that binder at the moment. You can see a slid that's in the top of [0:09:59]
 this pad. Crote a new sketch here. It's going to ask us to make an independent copy, etc. [0:10:04]
 But if we hide this blank body and then select the top of the binder and create a new sketch, [0:10:15]
 or place it on top of there. And we can add the sketch for our case. Which in this case [0:10:23]
 would be something like just a rounded rectangle. Like so. But if we're using a rounded rectangle [0:10:34]
 well, there's no need to use this sketch in here because we have our phone [0:10:41]
 which is a rounded rectangle anyway. I'm going to close that and delete the sketch. [0:10:48]
 Now at the spring back, the blank body and what we're trying to do is take some kind of shape [0:10:59]
 and create a body that can contain this so we can remove the blank away from the body. [0:11:04]
 The binder has offset. So we come down if we look at the options down here, we have an offset. [0:11:12]
 And we can use that to offset by say free mill and click off. See how the binder has moved away. [0:11:21]
 So if we get this to the right size, let's say 5 mill, I've been happy we want this. [0:11:30]
 Something like that. Then if we are screwed at this, we can enclose the whole of this [0:11:39]
 blank inside and remove the blank from the astute. Well in this case it would call a pad. [0:11:45]
 The first thing we need to do is move that binder now. We've created the offset. [0:11:51]
 Make sure the binder is selected and come up to the placement. There's placement here. [0:11:59]
 We need to move it along the z-axis. Now the reason why is if we move it down, [0:12:05]
 you can see we can get it to intersect the top of the shape here which about 3 millimetres. [0:12:13]
 The reason why we do that, well if we create a cut with it say here, then we're going to get [0:12:19]
 this length going upwards which we don't want. So instead of just the curve and the phone [0:12:26]
 fit inside here, you're going to have this height which we don't want. Let's move that down [0:12:33]
 to minus 3 mill. So we've got that there. Now click the binder and use the pad. We can pad a binder. [0:12:45]
 It's gone the wrong way at the moment. Click on reverse. That's reverse it downwards and we can [0:12:52]
 select the length. So that's set this to the middle of the 7 and click off. You can see while that's [0:12:59]
 come down but it's not cleared the phone. It's not given us the right depth. That's set this [0:13:07]
 to back to 10. So we have that there. This is a couple of millimetres on the bottom of the phone [0:13:16]
 and here okay. So we've got the case body now. This is basically the finished case body for the [0:13:24]
 time being before we do the cut. We're going to add to our afterwards. Now I say add to our afterwards [0:13:32]
 we could add say sketches around here for the ports and pocket those in there to a depth [0:13:40]
 or we could carry on and create the Boolean cut. If we add the ports then the cut will incorporate [0:13:49]
 those in there. Let me show you. So to do the Boolean cut between these I want to remove this blank [0:13:56]
 from this body. The one we want to keep is currently the active body so case body is the active [0:14:03]
 body it's in bolt. So we need that in bolt to go that body. So that's in bolt. This is the one we want to [0:14:12]
 keep. Make sure nothing's selected. Come on to part design. Boolean operation. The active body disappears. [0:14:21]
 So this means it's asking for body to take away or fuse against your active body. [0:14:29]
 Click add body and click on this body here the phone blank. It's added it but it's fused it. You can [0:14:39]
 see that the edges have taken. Come on to the left. Click where it says fuse. And click cut and we now [0:14:48]
 have the cut taken away from there. So that blank has been taken away from that rounded edge [0:14:55]
 rat angle. That's it. Okay. So now what we can do is add the bolts. So we can come in and [0:15:04]
 select this face here create a new sketch and start adding the port. So that's create a slot in here [0:15:15]
 like so. And take these two points. Make the smatch called with this vertical line. [0:15:22]
 Using a symmetric constraint. Not sure how wide my reports are so I'm just going to freestyle [0:15:29]
 this. That's add since circles in. So for the phone jack and the microphone that goes there [0:15:38]
 and then take these two points. And this point I make those in line. [0:15:44]
 And click close. We got that there. We can use that sketch by clicking on it and using the pocket. [0:15:53]
 And pop in a fruit the wall. However far I want to place that. I've got a five mill. [0:16:01]
 It doesn't go through just in cruisess and hit OK. And it's just the case of adding those features [0:16:10]
 in there. So for instance I've selected that face quite a sketch. And I could add a rectangle in here. [0:16:16]
 Let's say about here. We just measure it up. Figure out what it is. [0:16:21]
 For camera. Once they say our camera is in somewhere like this. And it closed. So that's there. [0:16:32]
 And we can use the pocket on that. Pocket all the way through. Link five mill. That's enough to get [0:16:40]
 through to the other side. And you can see well we're adding all the features we need for the cut out [0:16:48]
 that we need to be accessible from the phone. So it's a very simple case with this workflow. I'll just [0:16:57]
 build it up the features wherever we want to place them. And that is basically about it. [0:17:09]
 That's how simple this workflow is. And we end up with our end result. [0:17:17]
 So I hope that was useful. Remember if you want to follow the part workflow, then there's [0:17:25]
 another video for that. It takes you through the whole process. I've placed that in the description below. [0:17:31]
 And if you want to follow that workflow, very similar. But from a part workbench rather than part [0:17:35]
 design, it's there for your consumption if you want to. Hope you enjoyed that video and I hope to see [0:17:40]
