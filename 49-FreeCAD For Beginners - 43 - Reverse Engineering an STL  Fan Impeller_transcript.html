===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners - 43 - Reverse Engineering an STL  Fan Impeller =====
 I have one of the welcons of the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning [0:00:03]
 Free Capital beginners while teaching the fundamentals of free CAD whilst we learn workflows. [0:00:07]
 In this video we're going to reverse engineer a fan and color from an STL fault. [0:00:13]
 So this STL fault that's just show that. [0:00:17]
 That's been imported by downloading it from the internet and importing it into free CAD. [0:00:22]
 We're going to basically take this as a guide and create it from scratch. [0:00:25]
 I'm going to show you a way of doing that without converting to a shape and then converting [0:00:29]
 to body and refining it. [0:00:31]
 I know it's a very simple object. [0:00:33]
 We may want to rebuild this from scratch if we're going to make some modifications in there [0:00:37]
 and we want to tweak some of the design. [0:00:39]
 So I hope you find this video useful and that's going to have a look how we reverse engineer [0:00:43]
 something like this. [0:00:44]

 Links can be found in the channel header on the about page or in the descriptions of [0:01:15]
 these videos. [0:01:16]
 So this is the file we're going to be using. [0:01:19]
 It's available for thing of us and can be downloaded from here down low files and it's [0:01:24]
 a bathroom fan as all simple. [0:01:26]
 So we're going to load this into freecat after a stracking the zip and we're going to use [0:01:30]
 approaching there to reverse engineer it rather than converting to a solid. [0:01:35]
 So when we're freecat we can either use the file open and we point to the SDL or we could [0:01:43]
 use the create new and import such as create new file and cut to file and [0:01:49]
 import. [0:01:50]
 And we're just load the file, the SDL and just important there. [0:01:56]
 Now one thing that I like to do is come out to the view and toggle the access cross. [0:02:01]
 And this gives us a placement of the SDL. [0:02:04]
 So when this was exported, it was exported with the point of origin at this point. [0:02:11]
 So if I try to transform this right click transform, you can see that well we're right over here. [0:02:17]
 So when we do our modeling, I like to fix this. [0:02:22]
 Now I can turn this into a solid if I wanted to by coming over to the part workbench. [0:02:32]
 Click on the fan in Pella on the left hand side here and go to part. [0:02:38]
 Great shape from mesh and so shape and hit OK. [0:02:43]
 That will give me a shape. [0:02:45]
 We just hide the fan in Pella. [0:02:47]
 I click on the present space bar. [0:02:49]
 Click on the fan in Pella zero zero. [0:02:51]
 One the shape, go to part, create copy and refine shape. [0:02:56]
 That will convert it to something that we can use in reverse engineer. [0:03:01]
 But I'm going to do it a different way because I used this in a previous video. [0:03:05]
 So I'm going to show you a different way. [0:03:07]
 Let's take the fan in Pella and just delete it. [0:03:11]
 Delete the other one and bring back the original SDL. [0:03:14]
 As you can see when I hover over this, we've got no flashing and what I've done is come up to the edit preferences. [0:03:21]
 Now turn that flashing off. [0:03:23]
 This is the pre-selection. [0:03:25]
 So we're going to click on the display and the colors. [0:03:28]
 We've got this enable pre-selection highlighting. [0:03:31]
 If this was enabled in a hit OK, then each time I hover over this, you'll flash. [0:03:37]
 And it's not very good for demonstrations. [0:03:39]
 So I just turn that off. [0:03:41]
 And it's preferences. [0:03:44]
 Come to display colors. [0:03:47]
 enable pre-selection highlighting and hit OK. [0:03:51]
 We can even change it to a different color. [0:03:54]
 So we've got our fan in Pella. [0:03:56]
 What I'm going to do is create some cross sections because I'm going to rebuild this from scratch. [0:04:02]
 To do that, we need to come over to something called the mesh design. [0:04:07]
 Because this is a mesh, then we have some tools in here that I can use. [0:04:12]
 This one here is cross sections. [0:04:15]
 Also available from meshes cutting and come down to cross sections. [0:04:22]
 This will place a cross section along a plane. [0:04:26]
 So we're looking left-hand side panel here. [0:04:28]
 You can see we've got the different guidelines. [0:04:30]
 And I can add a cross section in there. [0:04:33]
 Next so. [0:04:35]
 I'm going to create multiple cross sections. [0:04:41]
 And we're going to increase the count and place it on both sides. [0:04:47]
 Well, this allows me to do is create cross sections through this model at different points. [0:04:55]
 So I'm going to increase the cross section up in counts. [0:04:59]
 So I've got a number of them. [0:05:00]
 And I've got cross section going, which is important, going across here. [0:05:04]
 This one here goes across here. That's add some more. [0:05:09]
 And it gives me an idea of what the model looks like at different cross sections. [0:05:15]
 Let's hit OK and what you'll see there will wrap around the model. [0:05:20]
 And we'll see those going all the way through this. [0:05:23]
 We get the dimension of this circle, the circle of the base. [0:05:27]
 We get an idea of where these fans start and end. [0:05:32]
 And this section that's taken out. If we look at it, we can see basically this is a sphere that's being removed from in here. [0:05:39]
 So we've got deal with that as well. [0:05:41]
 So now we've got a cross section in. [0:05:43]
 That's hide the fan impeller present space bot. [0:05:47]
 So we've got this. [0:05:49]
 We could say loft through this, but I want to rebuild this from the ground up. [0:05:54]
 So it's fully configurable. [0:05:56]
 That's how we look at that axis cross and see what it sits. [0:06:00]
 So the axis cross sits over here. [0:06:04]
 If I was going to reference this in this sketch, then I already want this centered. [0:06:09]
 To do that, I'm going to use a draft workbench and I'm going to center this fan impeller. [0:06:15]
 Let's come over to the draft workbench. [0:06:19]
 And I'm going to use the move tools in the draft workbench. [0:06:23]
 First thing is I'm going to click on top and set my work and plane. [0:06:28]
 Coming up to the utilities and select plane. [0:06:34]
 And we've got the working plane on the top there. So you can see on the top. [0:06:39]
 Zoom out. You can see the plane is on the top. [0:06:42]
 This means that when I move it will be on that plane. It makes it a lot easier to move. [0:06:49]
 We want to move this to the center. [0:06:55]
 Now this is where the snapping comes in. [0:06:58]
 If I click on the I found impeller, we can see all these snap poppidants. [0:07:02]
 And this is also available from down here. We've got snap options down here. [0:07:07]
 So snap lock and turn that on and off. [0:07:10]
 And we've got some selections down here. [0:07:12]
 This is the one we're looking for. This one here. [0:07:15]
 This got all the snap pins we need. We're looking for the center point. [0:07:19]
 Now if I take that fan impeller and come up to modifications and come down to the move. [0:07:26]
 We can select where we want to move this from. [0:07:30]
 So you can see the snapping is kicking in. [0:07:33]
 Now I want to center point on this circle here. [0:07:36]
 And I'm not getting that. [0:07:39]
 So I need to do something with this to allow for a center point. [0:07:42]
 And that's it. Close. [0:07:44]
 Now there's a little trick here. I'm going to show you. [0:07:47]
 Let's come over to the sketcher. [0:07:50]
 And I'm going to select top. [0:07:53]
 And I'm going to create a sketch. [0:07:55]
 So normal sketch. I haven't selected anything. [0:07:57]
 Let's create a sketch. [0:07:59]
 X Y plane on the top. [0:08:02]
 I'm not going to create a sketch here. What I'm going to do is [0:08:06]
 I'm going to put some geometry. [0:08:08]
 And I'm going to import these points on this circle like so. [0:08:14]
 And perhaps a point over here. [0:08:18]
 We're creating a circle in here. [0:08:22]
 I've got the old constraints on. [0:08:24]
 The one going to do to come out. [0:08:26]
 And I'm going to hit a skate because the mouse pointed back and take each of these points. [0:08:31]
 And this circle and use a point on object constraint. [0:08:35]
 And this will tie down this circle to the diameter that we need. [0:08:41]
 So what we've done is fix the geometry underneath. [0:08:44]
 Before it was a circle that was cut off. [0:08:47]
 That didn't have a center point. [0:08:48]
 To now be in an actual circle that we can snap to. [0:08:52]
 That means when I hit close. [0:08:54]
 I can use that. [0:08:56]
 So this comes out to the draft workbench. [0:09:00]
 And this is where the trick comes into effect. [0:09:03]
 So that's the top. [0:09:05]
 We can see that's circle there. [0:09:08]
 If I click on the fan in propeller cross sections, not the sketch. [0:09:12]
 And we've got the snapping. The snapping has moved up here. [0:09:15]
 So the snapping is actually up here. [0:09:18]
 And now it was. [0:09:20]
 If I move it back down, it was around about here. [0:09:24]
 I won't hear. So I've got the snapping here. [0:09:27]
 If I select that fan in propeller cross section. [0:09:31]
 Modifications and move. [0:09:35]
 Then because I've got the snapping on. [0:09:37]
 And I'm going to take these off. [0:09:40]
 Just to leave the snap center. [0:09:43]
 If I hover over this now and hover over this part, the sketch. [0:09:48]
 Notice where the center point is. [0:09:51]
 So I've actually fooled. [0:09:53]
 But I haven't actually fooled free counting. [0:09:55]
 Create a center point. [0:09:56]
 I've created a center point on that sketch. [0:09:58]
 And if I click that now, I can move my cross section. [0:10:06]
 Because I select the cross section. [0:10:08]
 Now I can move it into the center point and snap it to the center point there. [0:10:12]
 Like so. [0:10:13]
 So now I've got this centered. [0:10:15]
 The sketch hasn't moved. [0:10:17]
 I've just used that as a way of moving my fan in propeller. [0:10:22]
 The sketch I can delete is going to error anyway because we've moved this. [0:10:26]
 Move down like this. [0:10:27]
 Just delete that. [0:10:28]
 And now we've got this centered. [0:10:31]
 Let's take the grid enough. [0:10:34]
 Come back over to the part we're going to do now. [0:10:41]
 Let's take the fan in propeller and come up to part. [0:10:45]
 And this is compound. [0:10:47]
 A slow compound. [0:10:49]
 The reason why I've exploded is because we get the individual cross sections now. [0:10:54]
 The fan in propeller is hidden and inside we've got the individual cross sections. [0:10:59]
 So we can use these when creates now model. [0:11:02]
 And we can refer back to them. [0:11:04]
 I'm going to hide the more a set for this one. [0:11:07]
 So I want this one and I'm going to press the space bar on that. [0:11:10]
 I've hidden it. [0:11:11]
 This is another little trick. [0:11:12]
 See I've hidden it. [0:11:14]
 Let them all. [0:11:15]
 We've got quite a few in here. [0:11:16]
 Select them all. [0:11:17]
 Once hidden. [0:11:18]
 Press the space bar. [0:11:19]
 And what's happened is that we've toggled the visibility. [0:11:22]
 So all of once in our visible. [0:11:24]
 Have become hidden. [0:11:26]
 And the one that was hidden. [0:11:28]
 Which was the first one I selected is now visible. [0:11:32]
 And we've got the circle to start with. [0:11:35]
 That's used a part design workflow for this. [0:11:40]
 And then create a body. [0:11:42]
 And we're going to create sketch along the XY plane. [0:11:46]
 And here I go. [0:11:48]
 And let's just check our body. [0:11:51]
 If you find that well, you can see our sketch is there. [0:11:55]
 If you find anything else inside here, that means you've selected it. [0:12:00]
 Create a body and it's important in the space feature. [0:12:02]
 We can just delete that in there. [0:12:04]
 So now I can work with this. [0:12:06]
 I can say import this geometry now. [0:12:09]
 But it's not going to allow me to because. [0:12:13]
 It's external geometry. [0:12:15]
 So I can't select that. [0:12:16]
 It's outside. [0:12:17]
 I can pull this in with a subject binder. [0:12:20]
 But because it's simple geometry, I don't really need to. [0:12:23]
 So we're just creating a circle in here. [0:12:26]
 And match up. [0:12:28]
 Like for like like so. [0:12:30]
 And I can select that circle. [0:12:33]
 And create. [0:12:35]
 A diamond constraint. [0:12:38]
 And we know it's going to be about one one five. [0:12:41]
 And here okay. [0:12:43]
 So we've got our first piece of geometry in here. [0:12:46]
 Let's look at tasks and hit close. [0:12:48]
 So that's our first sketch. [0:12:51]
 And we're going to do is come up. [0:12:53]
 I won't need this circle anymore. [0:12:55]
 So I'm going to press a spacebar. [0:12:56]
 And I'm going to bring back the fan and color. [0:12:59]
 It's going to sit on the side. [0:13:00]
 Let's rotate this and have a look see what we got. [0:13:04]
 So now I'm going to pad this sketch. [0:13:07]
 So the sketch that we created, this one here, select it. [0:13:10]
 And pad it. [0:13:12]
 And well, we need to pad it this length here. [0:13:16]
 So I'm going to reduce the lengths to say 3 mil. [0:13:19]
 And this going to be about 2 mil wasn't it. [0:13:22]
 So we can use that there. [0:13:24]
 So that's 2 millimeters and here okay. [0:13:26]
 So we created our first part of the model. [0:13:31]
 I'm going to hide the fan and click on it and press a spacebar. [0:13:36]
 Now that's come down. [0:13:38]
 So we've got the circle inside our exploded fan. [0:13:41]
 In color cross sections, which we've used. [0:13:46]
 Now let's have a look at one of the others. [0:13:49]
 So I'm going to work my way through just press and spacebar. [0:13:52]
 So we'll get one that pops up on top. [0:13:54]
 That's fine. [0:13:55]
 This gives me a number of different geometries in here. [0:13:59]
 So it gives me the fan blade. [0:14:00]
 I'm going to select the face of this pad and create a sketch on it. [0:14:05]
 So now we're inside the sketch. [0:14:08]
 More you can see that we've got the blades here. [0:14:11]
 So we're going to start sketching in these blades. [0:14:14]
 That's worth thinking about how we're going to create this build. [0:14:18]
 Because we've got the dip in the middle of the sphere dip. [0:14:22]
 I could create say the circle part and a screw that up or pat that up. [0:14:28]
 But there's going to be removed fire that curved surface, [0:14:33]
 which will leave us basically a spherical dip in this. [0:14:37]
 So we're going to do this bit last. [0:14:40]
 I'm going to still create a circle in here. [0:14:43]
 That's create a circle. [0:14:45]
 Come out and get ourselves positioned at the top. [0:14:50]
 We'll move this out. [0:14:52]
 I'm not going to pull in any stone geometry because we don't need to. [0:14:56]
 This is circle. It's very simple. [0:14:58]
 That's used a dime to go straight. [0:15:00]
 Of 14 millimeters. [0:15:03]
 Now I'm going to turn this. [0:15:06]
 Let's click on it. [0:15:08]
 And set as construction geometry. [0:15:11]
 So I'm toggling that geometry to blue. [0:15:14]
 That is construction geometry now so that won't show up. [0:15:17]
 We're just using it to link two. [0:15:19]
 So we've got in there now we're going to start using one of these blades to create the blade. [0:15:25]
 While I'm here, that's pulling the edge of this circle. [0:15:29]
 The pulled in the edge of that circle as well. [0:15:34]
 So first of all, let's have a look to see what we've got. [0:15:37]
 We're going to be using arcs in here. [0:15:40]
 So I'm going to come up and use the end point and brim point arc. [0:15:45]
 Now I'm going to connect up. [0:15:47]
 I've got the auto constraints on. [0:15:49]
 We've avoided redundant constraints. [0:15:50]
 If you're on a newer version of free CAD, you'll find them in a little button here that you click and can select from the dropdown. [0:15:58]
 So later furshes at 0.21. [0:16:02]
 At the end point, we're in point arc. [0:16:05]
 I'm going to zoom out and position ourselves and we'll connect up to this arc and come out and connect up to this arc here as well. [0:16:14]
 And we'll create an arc that comes out and sits on the outside. [0:16:20]
 So we've got that one there. [0:16:22]
 Let's do the same on this side with a second arc, connect up to the construction geometry and connect up to the reference geometry. [0:16:31]
 So we've got the arc in there. [0:16:34]
 Now I'm moving arcs while I like this. [0:16:37]
 Well, you can see that we can move it and it'll move up down. [0:16:40]
 But when we start connecting these up, it can be a bit awkward to get them into position. [0:16:46]
 So that's great. [0:16:48]
 Another arc in here from this point and this point. [0:16:52]
 And we're not going to make it tangent to that to share. [0:16:55]
 We're going to come out and place it about here. [0:16:58]
 So we've got an arc here and now we're going to make it tangent to take this arc and this circle and apply tangency. [0:17:08]
 See what happens? They come together. [0:17:12]
 As it controls that, what we need to do, if I start moving this arc in, you can see what's happening in name move in like so. [0:17:19]
 We've got to stop these from connecting together like that. [0:17:22]
 There are a number of ways to do in this. I could pull in external arc here. [0:17:27]
 So this arc that comes around here. I can make a substrate binder on there. [0:17:31]
 Oh, we had a distance constraint between these two. [0:17:34]
 We're taking these two and creating a distance constraint. [0:17:39]
 Two points here, eight, that'll do us. [0:17:41]
 And then when we pull this arc in, you can see we've got more control over it now. [0:17:46]
 And I'll take this arc and this circle and make them tangent. [0:17:53]
 And then we'll just add some adjustments in here. [0:17:59]
 Let's do the same on the upper side. [0:18:02]
 Let's come over to the other side and add that in there. [0:18:07]
 And it sets in distance. We need to, well, first of all, let's get this in a bit more. [0:18:13]
 And aside where this is going to go, round about here and around about here. [0:18:20]
 Take these two. [0:18:23]
 Set a distance. [0:18:26]
 Two point eight, one, that's fine. [0:18:28]
 And set this one and this one and make the tangent. [0:18:33]
 Like so. We've got the tangent so you go across there. [0:18:38]
 We can make some small iterations in here so I can pull this in. [0:18:42]
 Right, so and decide where this is going to go. [0:18:45]
 I'm quite happy with that. [0:18:55]
 That's hit close. [0:18:58]
 So we've got that in there. [0:19:00]
 We can pad that now. [0:19:02]
 So I'll slide that sketch and hit the pad. [0:19:05]
 You see that pad's up. [0:19:07]
 Now this is where we need to bring back the SDL file. [0:19:13]
 So the fan in part of the mesh, press the spacebar. [0:19:18]
 And we see that we've got the blade here. [0:19:21]
 So let's go back to the task and increase the pad up. [0:19:26]
 And we go all the way up to the top. [0:19:30]
 And well, that's getting there. [0:19:33]
 I think it's going to be 23.5 myself. [0:19:36]
 Maybe 24. [0:19:39]
 Okay, that's 23. [0:19:46]
 And so hit okay. [0:19:49]
 Once we got that in there, that's hide the fan in pillar. [0:19:53]
 And press the spacebar. [0:19:55]
 So we've got our first blade. [0:19:58]
 I'm going to leave these cross sections on view because we're going to pull away this now. [0:20:03]
 To do that, let's come back to the next step. [0:20:06]
 And we're going to go back to the next step. [0:20:09]
 I'm going to leave these cross sections on view because we're going to pull away this now. [0:20:14]
 To do that, let's come back down to the blade, which is the pad. [0:20:20]
 It will select all of this, which is absolutely fine. [0:20:23]
 This is just the action. [0:20:24]
 Let's be infused to the underlying geometry. [0:20:26]
 The guy to the part design. [0:20:29]
 Apply pattern and hit puller pattern. [0:20:33]
 And we're starting to pull the pattern this around here. [0:20:36]
 And we can increase this to the amount we want. [0:20:40]
 So we got eight occurrences and those sit across there. [0:20:47]
 Like so. [0:20:48]
 Let's hit okay. [0:20:51]
 So the next stage is to create a did surfacing here. [0:20:57]
 So if we look back, this is the spherical negative space. [0:21:02]
 We've got our fan in pillar. [0:21:05]
 We've got a dip. [0:21:07]
 That comes down in here. [0:21:10]
 Press the space bar. [0:21:13]
 We're going to use the subtractive tools. [0:21:16]
 So the subtractive primitives, and you can see that we've got a yellow cube here. [0:21:20]
 And a red cube. [0:21:22]
 This is added to the primitives. [0:21:24]
 This is the subtractive primitives. [0:21:25]
 To use it, we select the face. [0:21:27]
 And I'm going to come onto the part design. [0:21:29]
 Create a subtractive primitive and come down to the sphere. [0:21:34]
 It actually hasn't added it to that face. [0:21:38]
 So we're saying selecting click on the face there. [0:21:42]
 And that's placed it upon that face. [0:21:44]
 See face too. [0:21:46]
 And we can move this into position. [0:21:48]
 First of all, let's give it some radius. [0:21:51]
 So I'm going to say about 30. [0:21:54]
 And what I really need is to come in and have a look at some of the cross sections. [0:22:01]
 So I'm going to select the cross sections. [0:22:03]
 This may add it in the attached to those cross sections. [0:22:06]
 We'll be where that. [0:22:08]
 And let's take, like the last 10 or so. [0:22:12]
 Close there and press the space bar. [0:22:14]
 So we can see that. [0:22:17]
 And we see where the cross sections come out. [0:22:20]
 So they're coming out about here. [0:22:23]
 Come out to the task and see what we've done. [0:22:26]
 So we can see by adding those, we've got wire wire wire, which is because we [0:22:31]
 select them. [0:22:32]
 Let's just delete those out. [0:22:34]
 And just leave the face too. [0:22:38]
 So we've got playing face too. [0:22:41]
 Let's sit there. [0:22:45]
 We'll move this now. [0:22:46]
 So we've come down to the bottom. [0:22:49]
 Look at the Z axis. [0:22:51]
 So we want to move it on the Z axis. [0:22:54]
 In Z direction. [0:22:55]
 And we'll move the sphere up into place. [0:22:59]
 And actually 30 is around about right. [0:23:04]
 So we can see where it intersects here. [0:23:08]
 In Z direction of 36. [0:23:11]
 And we've got 30 along the radius. [0:23:13]
 And I'm going to hit OK. [0:23:16]
 The structure sphere would have removed the material for the blaze. [0:23:22]
 Let's make it look like this. [0:23:24]
 So we've got that sphere in there. [0:23:26]
 Let's compare this to our original model. [0:23:32]
 I found impeller. [0:23:38]
 And if I'm not happy with this, I can basically come back into the sphere. [0:23:44]
 And adjust this with the radius. [0:23:47]
 Let's come down to say 29. [0:23:52]
 So we're reducing the radius down there. [0:23:55]
 And actually I'm going to go to 32. [0:23:58]
 And you see the points. [0:24:00]
 Is that cross section. [0:24:02]
 So we can adjust that. [0:24:04]
 The height, the set trip to places in the right place. [0:24:07]
 I'm just going to go with a 30. [0:24:10]
 Another thing is that I'm not happy with this line that goes across here. [0:24:15]
 Now this is a niche that connects up the poles through the equator. [0:24:19]
 That's made this extra facing here in this edge. [0:24:23]
 So I'm going to come into the sphere. [0:24:25]
 And we're going to rotate that. [0:24:27]
 Look at the attachment because that's first angle. [0:24:31]
 And we'll just rotate that. [0:24:33]
 And we'll see those rotate. [0:24:34]
 And hit the refresh edit. [0:24:38]
 Refresh control R. [0:24:41]
 And that's place that there. [0:24:43]
 That's go a bit further. [0:24:46]
 Ctraw on the Linux operating systems or you've been to operation systems. [0:24:51]
 And that's now being removed. [0:24:56]
 We just rotated that sphere around. [0:25:01]
 We've got one final operation for the padding. [0:25:05]
 That's how I had that impeller. [0:25:08]
 Actually we leave that there. We'll hide the cross sections. [0:25:10]
 I'll space on the cross section. [0:25:12]
 We've got this feature here. [0:25:14]
 To do that, select the face. [0:25:17]
 And create a new sketch. [0:25:20]
 Pull that face. [0:25:23]
 And we'll say bring in some geometry. [0:25:26]
 That's bringing the geometry of this edge here. [0:25:29]
 Just bring that in now. [0:25:31]
 Push it on side face. [0:25:33]
 Projects it onto that face. [0:25:35]
 Sketch. [0:25:37]
 View section to create a cross section view there. [0:25:41]
 And create a circle. [0:25:44]
 So create a circle. [0:25:45]
 I've got the old constraints on so I can connect up to that point there. [0:25:49]
 So this point, just connect up there. [0:25:51]
 And we're created that circle. [0:25:54]
 Just constrained to go to that point. [0:25:58]
 Let's close that. [0:26:00]
 I've got a circle in there. [0:26:01]
 And what we're going to do is pad that now. [0:26:04]
 To that sketch, we're using the meshes reference. [0:26:08]
 And what we know is actually where this is going to go because this is going to come up to this edge here. [0:26:17]
 So this edge. [0:26:18]
 If you want to go beyond your can. [0:26:22]
 But we can come into the direction slash edge. [0:26:24]
 Come down and select reference. [0:26:27]
 And we'll select an edge as reference. [0:26:31]
 And we go. [0:26:34]
 So it's sphere edge 107. [0:26:37]
 That's not really worth that. [0:26:38]
 That's like normal. [0:26:40]
 And just use the dimension in here. [0:26:43]
 I thought I was going to do the length for that edge. [0:26:50]
 But actually it is just the direction. [0:26:53]
 So I'm just coming in and just changing this a bit. [0:26:55]
 So six point eight. [0:26:58]
 It's close. [0:27:02]
 Maybe a little bit more. [0:27:05]
 Nope, I think I'm going to go for that. That's here. Okay. [0:27:10]
 So we've now got most of this done. [0:27:14]
 We need the hole in here. So we've got this hole here. [0:27:17]
 And this is up to you what way you want to do this hole. [0:27:20]
 Because you may want to different type of hole in here. [0:27:24]
 I've actually got a bit of a dip here as well. [0:27:27]
 So I'm going to add that. [0:27:29]
 Again, we select a face. [0:27:32]
 You sketch. [0:27:35]
 Add the circle coming in. [0:27:38]
 Which is straight to that. [0:27:39]
 Midpoint. Come out. [0:27:42]
 And set some dimensions on the radius. [0:27:47]
 12.8. [0:27:50]
 Close that. [0:27:52]
 So we've got that there. [0:27:55]
 And a pocket. [0:27:58]
 Go for a millimeter. [0:28:00]
 Click off and you can see that there. That's actually do 0.5. [0:28:03]
 I think this will be for some kind of washer or something that goes in there. [0:28:07]
 So that's there. That's it. Okay. [0:28:10]
 And now I can do the final pocket by selecting the face. [0:28:14]
 New sketch. [0:28:16]
 And add a circle. [0:28:18]
 So come in. [0:28:19]
 We'll just strengthen the center and the circle. [0:28:22]
 And this will be. [0:28:23]
 Which ever type of connect to your using it here. [0:28:26]
 So I'm going to add a diota. [0:28:29]
 Oh, if I say free milk and here. Okay. [0:28:33]
 To go that there. [0:28:34]
 Close. [0:28:35]
 And then we'll. [0:28:37]
 That's pocket that. [0:28:38]
 And we can go. [0:28:43]
 Say. [0:28:44]
 Through all. [0:28:45]
 Out the other side. [0:28:46]
 And here. [0:28:47]
 Okay. [0:28:49]
 Now I'm going to come up and hide this. [0:28:52]
 So I do fan in power cross sections. [0:28:55]
 For instance, spacebar. [0:28:56]
 Fan in power for spacebar. [0:28:58]
 And we've got. [0:29:00]
 Our model. [0:29:02]
 So we completed our model. [0:29:04]
 Now one thing to remember is because we've centered this. [0:29:08]
 You can see how well that centered. [0:29:10]
 If we didn't do that. [0:29:12]
 And we started pulling in the circles. [0:29:15]
 Then we're going to get ourselves into a bit of a state. [0:29:18]
 We may end up constrain in this with it not centered. [0:29:23]
 So this wouldn't run properly when we put it on a motor. [0:29:27]
 It will have a wobble to it. [0:29:29]
 And nothing will line up. [0:29:31]
 So center in is very important when it comes to something like this. [0:29:35]
 You can say this. [0:29:37]
 And one thing that I want to show is if we look at these edges. [0:29:40]
 You can see. [0:29:41]
 This quite jacket edge. [0:29:43]
 That can be fixed. [0:29:45]
 That's just deviation. [0:29:46]
 It can actually be fixed in the preferences. [0:29:49]
 So we can set up preferences on the part design. [0:29:53]
 Shape appearance. [0:29:54]
 Actually it's shaped view. [0:29:56]
 And set the maximum deviation in here. [0:29:59]
 And this will affect both part and part design. [0:30:02]
 Also draft. [0:30:03]
 So we can set that in there. [0:30:05]
 Or we can come down to the model. [0:30:08]
 Quick on the body. [0:30:10]
 View. [0:30:12]
 Deviation. [0:30:13]
 No point. [0:30:15]
 No. [0:30:16]
 And see how those edges are cleared up. [0:30:20]
 And this makes it easier when we're creating the circle. [0:30:24]
 The edges. [0:30:25]
 It's much cleaner model to work with. [0:30:27]
 It's made our life a bit easier. [0:30:29]
 And we can see the effect. [0:30:31]
 So that's a fan impeller. [0:30:33]
 Using the part design. [0:30:34]
 Import in an SDL. [0:30:37]
 And creating cross sections. [0:30:40]
 We'll let it have to center that. [0:30:42]
 And that's one way of reverse engineering. [0:30:45]
 This type of item from SDL. [0:30:47]
 Right for them. [0:30:48]
 Going through and creating a shape from that and converted to solid and doing it that way. [0:30:53]
