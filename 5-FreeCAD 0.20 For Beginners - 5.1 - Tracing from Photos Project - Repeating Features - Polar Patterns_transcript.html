===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 5.1 - Tracing from Photos Project - Repeating Features - Polar Patterns =====
 Hi and welcome back to the Learning FreeCath for Beginner Series. [0:00:03]
 We're on part five where we're teaching the fundamentals of freecath using practical [0:00:07]
 examples and exploring workflows. [0:00:10]
 In the previous lesson we looked at tracing. [0:00:12]
 In this lesson we're going to carry on with tracing but we're going to be doing a [0:00:15]
 project over two videos. [0:00:17]
 In the first video we're going to trace a part in the sketch you're using a part [0:00:22]
 design workflow. [0:00:23]
 We're going to create a model from a number of images. [0:00:27]
 These will be used as a tracing reference. [0:00:29]
 In this video we're going to be looking at the workflow through the part design we'll [0:00:33]
 create a sketch of one of the features using the part design and the image workbench. [0:00:39]
 And we're going to be looking at a repeating feature. [0:00:42]
 So we've got a feature in there that we'll save time by repeating the feature around [0:00:47]
 a circular path. [0:00:48]
 This will be known as a polar pattern. [0:00:51]
 The result will be a sketch of part of this feature and as you can see it's been repeated [0:00:56]
 four times to create the finished part. [0:00:59]
 We'll be later using that in the end results to create this model. [0:01:04]
 So I hope you've enjoyed your journey so far and that's how we'll do this. [0:01:10]

 Any money that's kindly donated will be used to span the channel. [0:01:35]
 So we're in freecat, create new document and we're jumping over to the image workbench. [0:01:41]
 From here we can import the image using the creating image plane. [0:01:47]
 We'll just locate the image and we'll import it. [0:01:54]
 This is the top image so we're looking down on the top so I'm going for the x-y plane. [0:01:59]
 And that will import the image and we'll just rotate our view so it's in front of us and [0:02:05]
 click top. [0:02:06]
 We'll construct our image and we'll need to scale this image down. [0:02:12]
 Using the tool to scale. [0:02:15]
 Now with this image I know some dimensions in here. [0:02:19]
 I haven't got any references but I know that going from across here. [0:02:25]
 So I've clicked once and then click to gain. [0:02:29]
 Most two edges. [0:02:32]
 That this is 38mm. [0:02:37]
 We select the image plane and then hit OK. [0:02:40]
 This is now to scale. [0:02:42]
 So I zoom in I can use the ruler just to get a rough scale from here to here. [0:02:48]
 We can see that's 38mm. [0:02:52]
 To rename this image plane. [0:02:54]
 So we can keep track of what we're doing. [0:02:59]
 Before we tackle any of the other images we're going to learn how to trace this image using [0:03:04]
 a sketch. [0:03:05]
 Part design workflow and something called a polar pattern. [0:03:09]
 This means that we only need to trace one of these features to allow us to copy it to [0:03:14]
 all of these. [0:03:15]
 It's a one feature for the four features. [0:03:18]
 Let's come over to the part design workbench and start creating our new sketch. [0:03:22]
 Now we're in the part design workbench. [0:03:24]
 We can follow the tasks to guide us through the workflow or we could use the tool bar [0:03:31]
 up the top. [0:03:32]
 So first of all we need a new body so we can click on task and create body. [0:03:37]
 And then it will guide us to create a sketch. [0:03:41]
 We're looking down on the object so you can see we've got the x, y plane here. [0:03:45]
 So we click the x, y plane and here OK. [0:03:50]
 This throws us into a sketcher. [0:03:55]
 To allow us to use a polar pattern we really need to be centered because polar means [0:04:00]
 circle so we need to be in the center of this object before we start sketching. [0:04:06]
 To do that I'm going to move the image behind this sketch into position. [0:04:13]
 So we click on the model, click on the top plane image, come down to the placement. [0:04:17]
 That's the span of the sensor we can see what we're doing. [0:04:20]
 Come down to the position and we've got the x, y and z. [0:04:24]
 Now we're going to use the x, y and z from the handler or from an navigation cube. [0:04:32]
 Then use the red and the green lines because these are associated with the sketch. [0:04:38]
 So this is the x, this is the y and the z is always normal to the sketch pointed towards you. [0:04:43]
 And that means that says at the same on each plane. [0:04:48]
 We need to use the global coordinate system here so we can see y, x and z. [0:04:53]
 So I need to move this along the y and we can just use the up and down arrow keys or [0:04:59]
 type in a number in here minus down plus up so you can see it's got minus three and [0:05:05]
 we move that down. [0:05:07]
 And that is basically I was saying position. [0:05:12]
 We've just got a just the x and I'm going to put a 0.5 on there. [0:05:19]
 I'm changing that to 0.5. [0:05:22]
 So we should be position-crediting now. [0:05:24]
 I'm going to start sketching part of this object. [0:05:29]
 Now to use a polar pattern I need to just sketch this part here and part of this. [0:05:36]
 First of all I'm going to show you how a polar pattern works. [0:05:39]
 If I created say a shaping here using some lines so we're going to line up to the [0:05:49]
 quarter of this circle. [0:05:51]
 So two lines here and an arc. [0:05:56]
 We use the end point of the end point of the end point arc. [0:05:59]
 Connecting up these points and creating a curve. [0:06:04]
 What we're doing is we're bringing this into the center and attach it to there with a [0:06:09]
 quince and constraint. [0:06:10]
 Then we've got basically a section here. [0:06:14]
 Now I've got a point of line constraint which I'm not happy there so I'm going to delete [0:06:17]
 that. [0:06:18]
 I just put a vertical constraint because I want to show you what happens when we start [0:06:26]
 to move this. [0:06:30]
 So a vertical constraint along there. [0:06:33]
 So those are constraint. [0:06:35]
 If I come over and hit close and hide the top lane so that image has gone, we can [0:06:44]
 pad this sketch by using the pad tools and we'll give it a 10mm pad. [0:06:51]
 So we've got this section here. [0:06:54]
 What we can then do is click on the pad and then come up to the part design and apply [0:07:01]
 a pattern and you'll notice that we've got polar pattern there. [0:07:04]
 It's also available on the toolbar with the same icon. [0:07:07]
 When we click that we see we've got some transformation problems. [0:07:12]
 But this feature is being mirrored over to the left hand side. [0:07:18]
 On the left hand side you'll see we have an axis here and also we have the occurrences [0:07:24]
 which at the moment too. [0:07:26]
 Let's increase this to four. [0:07:28]
 You can see how this has been increased. [0:07:31]
 They do not touch at the moment this one. [0:07:34]
 Increase it once more and they have connected. [0:07:38]
 The axis that this is on is normal to sketch. [0:07:42]
 That means it's facing away from the sketch. [0:07:44]
 So we sketch this part here with a sketch that's sitting on the top lane. [0:07:49]
 The normal sketch axis will be the axis that's pointing towards us and this is the one [0:07:54]
 we've chosen here. [0:07:56]
 We can change this to vertical sketch axis and you can see what's happened there. [0:08:06]
 We're going to horizontal sketch axis and then we can use the base x, the base y and the [0:08:14]
 base z. [0:08:16]
 So that's all be these axis is here. [0:08:19]
 We're going along there. [0:08:24]
 You can see because we've got four evenly placed sections that this creates a full circle. [0:08:30]
 This is the technique we're going to be using for sketching those features in our sketch [0:08:36]
 because if we go back to our sketch, that's just the lead that pop out and I click on that [0:08:41]
 and press the lead key and also delete the pad as well. [0:08:45]
 Go back to the sketch and bring in the top lane. [0:08:50]
 Then it would be no point in sketching these individually because we'd be just wasting [0:08:55]
 our time. [0:08:56]
 Now the thing to remember is that those created section here, these features aren't within [0:09:03]
 this slice. [0:09:04]
 So we need to figure out how we're going to deal with this. [0:09:07]
 We still want the four sections and the easiest way to do that is to take these horizontal [0:09:13]
 constraints off horizontal to vertical is that we can just bring this around this way. [0:09:22]
 I make sure that the angle between these using the angle, straight angle, is 90 degrees. [0:09:35]
 So we've got a 90 degree angle that allows us to do the free sexting. [0:09:42]
 So we can look to see on this feature we'll slice it through here and here and just build [0:09:50]
 this section and then repeat this around so we've got four sections going around here. [0:10:03]
 So what I've done is just delete that sketch at that body. [0:10:05]
 Go into the body and create the sketch along the xy plane and here okay. [0:10:13]
 We need to position our object to the top lane into the correct position so I'm going [0:10:18]
 to come in and that's the x into position around our null point five and the y is nothing [0:10:28]
 down our case just to get a self's into position. [0:10:31]
 So I'm going to switch this so we're going to divide this into number of segments. [0:10:40]
 So four segments, now let's just sketch this top one and repeat it around the four segments. [0:10:47]
 Therefore we need to create a 90 degree segment so if it's 90 around our 360 degrees [0:10:52]
 of circle for that we're going to use a line and come down and connect to that point [0:11:00]
 and then come across another line, click and over here somewhere. [0:11:06]
 It's going to go to the mouse point about and change both these lines to construction [0:11:10]
 geometry and we'll set an angle between these two with an angle constraint of 90 degrees. [0:11:20]
 Those are in position that's make those two equal to one. [0:11:23]
 It's equal to going slow and we're coming and I'm going to place this point where this [0:11:30]
 arc starts so where this arc starts I'm going to place it along there. [0:11:36]
 Now we need some arcs to follow this line around so I'm going to come in and use the center [0:11:43]
 and end point arc. [0:11:45]
 Half over over the center point because we've got the order constraints on, click come up. [0:11:50]
 Half over over this point, see if we're quinsant and straight and we're bringing the arc [0:11:54]
 all the way around and connect. [0:11:57]
 We've got over constraints there so let's have a look see what we got. [0:12:00]
 We've got a redundant constraint which is number four which is this equality and we're [0:12:05]
 going to hit delete on that because we got that arc connecting up those two. [0:12:09]
 We're creating that for our arc now. [0:12:12]
 Center, come out and use the inner arc there and connect up. [0:12:18]
 Those are connected. [0:12:20]
 That's add a line between these so this line to this one. [0:12:26]
 Point and point constraint or quinsant constraint and we do the same over here as well. [0:12:32]
 We've got our first section in here. [0:12:36]
 We need to set some radius so we set the radius of the outside. [0:12:40]
 I'm going to fact let's just set the radius so we've got the radius and just click. [0:12:46]
 That's 17. [0:12:47]
 We still got that tool enabled so we've set it in the one and set that 15. [0:12:56]
 So those are in there we need to come in and just position this point about where this [0:13:03]
 feature starts here. [0:13:06]
 We can then set the angle between this line and this line of 15 degrees and that's all set [0:13:19]
 there. [0:13:20]
 Hit a scape at the mouse point of back and we can start sketching this feature. [0:13:25]
 Just do that I'm going to use a number of arcs and symmetry. [0:13:28]
 That's used our end point and room point arc and we're going to connect up point on point [0:13:34]
 or quinsant constraint here and make our first arc and bring this in. [0:13:40]
 Make our second arc and then make our next one. [0:13:45]
 We're coming right away across and make that arc there. [0:13:51]
 We're going to connect up to this line and make that curve of a chuck. [0:13:58]
 We've got all these here point on line constraint here to get a mouse point of back and [0:14:05]
 we can start just bring this in and that's made between these two. [0:14:12]
 A tangency constraint. [0:14:14]
 Same with this one. [0:14:16]
 That just the constraint. [0:14:20]
 So those are nice and smooth now. [0:14:23]
 We can move those in. [0:14:24]
 You can see this one moves up and down. [0:14:26]
 Well I don't want that one to move up and down. [0:14:28]
 So I'm going to click on there and find the center of that arc so I can see that [0:14:33]
 center is there. [0:14:34]
 So I can take that point and this line and connect that up. [0:14:38]
 Because that will keep that on that line and we'll place it just so it [0:14:44]
 touches that edge and then restrict this one down to this point with a high constraint of 8mm. [0:14:54]
 So that one's in there and we need actually to have that smetch call that's not smetch call [0:15:05]
 yeah let's take these two points and this one and use a smetch constraint. [0:15:12]
 We will get over constraint because I've added this one in here number 23. [0:15:18]
 Let's click it and we can see that point on line we don't actually need that we just need that some [0:15:24]
 distance away from there. [0:15:26]
 So you can see how the autoconstraints kick in and remove any constraint that you made. [0:15:32]
 Mistake with or just to get that point in place so we can move forward. [0:15:38]
 So now I want to get this nicely positioned around here and that's take these two points. [0:15:53]
 So these are the centers of the arc so I'm going to use those and make them smetch call to that one. [0:16:00]
 So it's that one's that the other one is that last one you want to make it's smetch call 2 which is [0:16:04]
 this line and we can start getting these into position. [0:16:09]
 So you can see how much easier this is to actually start molded this into position. [0:16:15]
 So using the centers of the arc's make sure there's nothing to let you first [0:16:22]
 so let the two and let this line and make a smetch call constraint across there. [0:16:29]
 And we can pull one out and decide where it's going to sit. [0:16:36]
 Now there's many ways of constraining these and it may take some time. [0:16:41]
 We've got symmetry across here so we can start constraining these down to make this all green. [0:16:45]
 We've got five degrees of freedom at the moment. [0:16:48]
 So that's set the radius of these so we're going to take this one set the radius. [0:16:56]
 2.5. [0:17:00]
 Just slightly set this one. [0:17:04]
 Radius of two and set the radius of this one as well. [0:17:12]
 And this one is 10.75. [0:17:20]
 It's slightly higher that's fine. [0:17:22]
 So now we've got this and you can see that we've got much more restricted down [0:17:28]
 in and out movement basically with these not up and down. [0:17:32]
 I hit controls edges to get them back into position. [0:17:37]
 We've got two degrees of freedom let's click and we can see that these points here and this. [0:17:44]
 So that's a lot down these two. [0:17:45]
 We've got one degree of freedom now. [0:17:51]
 So there's one thing that we need to sort and I think it's just going to be this here. [0:18:00]
 So this one and this one. [0:18:02]
 I'm going to place the length in there. [0:18:04]
 Or five millimeters. [0:18:06]
 So that's all locked down. [0:18:08]
 We can now start trimming some of this away. [0:18:11]
 So I'm looking at the object where we need some lines actually. [0:18:13]
 So that's getting the lines in here from here to here and the same. [0:18:19]
 Make sure it's got a vertical constraint. [0:18:27]
 I'm going to place them symmetrical to taking these two points and the center line is one here. [0:18:35]
 Make sure that's slatted so these two points stay the bond points actually. [0:18:42]
 So these two and this center line is one here and do symmetry. [0:18:48]
 We've constrained number 35 so I click number 35 and delete and that's in symmetrical constraint there. [0:18:57]
 And what I might do is actually just take this line and this point. [0:19:01]
 So the center of that arc and put a point on line constraint on point objects. [0:19:07]
 So now we're fully constrained. [0:19:09]
 We need to trim this so we need to remove this line here and these lines at the top. [0:19:15]
 We may start to remove some of the constraints when we start trimming. [0:19:19]
 So we have to be careful that. [0:19:20]
 So let's hit the trim top and that's the trim in this line here. [0:19:25]
 So the trim we can see that we're already lost constraints. [0:19:30]
 Here's Skype and just move so this constraint we can see what's happened. [0:19:36]
 We no longer got a height restriction against this one. [0:19:40]
 You can see one degree of freedom and these arcs here are the calls of the issue. [0:19:48]
 Here controls that just put that back in position and make sure nothing's slatted. [0:19:53]
 The more going to do just slat the center point and come down and slat this center point. [0:19:57]
 And place a height in there. [0:20:01]
 A 14.54. [0:20:02]
 Everything's gone green again and I'm going to carry on with the trimming. [0:20:07]
 So the next one is this one and then last of all this one. [0:20:13]
 So we're fully constrained and we're already to go. [0:20:17]
 Doesn't matter how you can strain this you may have more constraints less constraints in there. [0:20:23]
 We've just got fully constrained sketch and we're safe to use that. [0:20:26]
 As it close and click on the top plane and press the space bar and we've got our sketch ready to go. [0:20:35]
 Now click on the sketch and select the paddle and it is now starting to pad. [0:20:43]
 One thing that you want to be wary of is that if you come into this sketch, [0:20:49]
 if this is not fully constrained and say we had a break in this. [0:20:56]
 For instance, let's put two lines in here like so. [0:21:00]
 And what I'm going to do is just trim in the middle. [0:21:04]
 So we trimmed out that line there and we'll delete these two lines. [0:21:10]
 So I've just split it by in half. [0:21:12]
 If this was just sitting over the top of here. [0:21:16]
 Then that looks like there's nothing wrong with this sketch. [0:21:21]
 It looks like it's clenched up but it's not constrained. [0:21:24]
 If I hit close and try to pad that now, [0:21:27]
 it will disappear. It goes into error. [0:21:30]
 You can see we can put a fold on the bottom. [0:21:32]
 We can find that problem by coming up to the sketch and validate sketch. [0:21:39]
 But first we must select sketch and sketch and validate sketch. [0:21:44]
 Here we've got a highlight troublesome vertices. [0:21:47]
 Click that. You can see in yellow. [0:21:49]
 That's highlighted there. [0:21:51]
 And you can see as we zoom in they pop. [0:21:55]
 So we can just fix that. [0:21:56]
 Let's go into the sketch and just control set that. [0:22:00]
 And there we go. We've got it back. [0:22:05]
 Let's close that and create our pad. [0:22:12]
 I'm just going to go for the default of 10 millimeters here. [0:22:15]
 And now I'm going to create a polar ray of this. [0:22:19]
 So click on the pad. [0:22:21]
 Come up to the part design. [0:22:22]
 Come up to apply a pattern and come down to polar pattern. [0:22:27]
 It will say the transformation is not successful. [0:22:32]
 We can see it's over here and this because it's disconnected from this body. [0:22:36]
 Now remember the axis is in the middle. [0:22:40]
 So it'd be rotation around the axis. [0:22:42]
 If we drop down we can see what axis it is. [0:22:45]
 No one to sketch. As we said before if you got sketch the axis that is normal to sketch is the z axis. [0:22:51]
 So this z axis here is not actually the axis of the sketch. [0:22:59]
 Here's the axis of the base z this one here. [0:23:03]
 We can use either or normal to sketch or z axis. [0:23:05]
 That's increases currents to free. [0:23:08]
 And now for and we can see that's all connected up there. [0:23:14]
 Yeah okay and we now have our feature. [0:23:19]
 But you can see we've got these lines in here that's going across here. [0:23:23]
 You may not want that because it creates extra faces. [0:23:26]
 We can remove those, click on the polar pun. [0:23:28]
 Come down to the refine on the data tab. [0:23:30]
 And what this does is it just removes those redundant faces. [0:23:35]
 Click off now. [0:23:36]
 I've sent that to true. We've got one face and reduced faces going around the outside. [0:23:42]
 That's our feature completed. [0:23:45]
 We'll now move on to [0:23:50]
 understanding how we can create the rest of this object. [0:23:54]
 We'll now take out parts being created from the Puder array [0:23:57]
 and using a number of reference images, trace and create our finished model. [0:24:03]
 And that will be available in the second video to this part. [0:24:06]
 And should be available on my channel in the next few days if not available now. [0:24:11]
