===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners 44a - Modelling a Fan - Part Workbench Array and Intersection Workflow =====
 Hi everyone and welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another episode of the Learning [0:00:03]
 Free Cat for Beginners. [0:00:05]
 Today we're going to be looking at creating this fan blade and we're going to be creating [0:00:10]
 it in both the part and part design. [0:00:13]
 So this two videos, this one will be for the part and there'll be additional video that [0:00:18]
 will be released for the part design so if you want to use either of those workflows [0:00:23]
 and you've got a preference over a workbench or you just want to see the differences between [0:00:27]
 those two work benches and differences between the two workflows then you can do so. [0:00:32]
 So it's a very simple fan that we're going to be creating and that's look how to do [0:00:37]
 this first in the part workbench. [0:00:40]
 If you like what you're seeing you want to donate to the channel then you can do so via [0:00:43]
 co-fi or coffee at k-o-hifinf-i.com, 4-slashma-ng-0 or via PayPal at p-pal.com, 4-slash-paypal [0:00:54]
 for me, 4-slash-daren-be-e-stone, also around a Patreon week can get early access and additional [0:00:59]
 content and that's at patreon.com, 4-slash-mango-jelly solutions. [0:01:05]
 Links can be found in the channel header on the about page or in the descriptions of these [0:01:09]
 videos. [0:01:10]
 So start with, I'm in free-cad and I've created a new document. [0:01:16]
 We're going to be using a part workflow for this one. [0:01:19]
 So let's come over to the sketcher and I'm going to come up to view and toggle the access [0:01:25]
 cross. [0:01:26]
 This lets me know where the center of the scene is because we want to build everything [0:01:30]
 around a center point to allow it to rotate properly. [0:01:33]
 I'm going to create a new sketch, long- yet swipe plane looking down. [0:01:38]
 So you can see here, point of origin here, the fan I'm going to create is going to have [0:01:42]
 free blades. [0:01:44]
 You can add more if you want to. [0:01:45]
 So for that I'm going to build it just in this quadrant here. [0:01:48]
 So we're going to come up and use the center and endpoint arc. [0:01:56]
 Now I've got the alticon strengths on, so I've looked over the other side. [0:01:59]
 I've got the alticon strengths on. [0:02:00]
 If you're using later versions and alticon, then you'll have a drop down here. [0:02:04]
 We can turn these alticon strengths on and avoid redundant alticon strengths. [0:02:08]
 I'm going to alticon strengths the center, come up and create an arc. [0:02:14]
 Now this is where the center spindle's going to be. [0:02:16]
 So we can set a radius on here, so click on the arc, come up to the radius, and set this [0:02:24]
 to 20mm. [0:02:26]
 We're going to use the vertical and horizontal axis guidelines. [0:02:31]
 If we've got a different fan and it's smaller, then we can add some lines in here to say [0:02:37]
 something like this and set angle constraints between these two. [0:02:42]
 We're going to angle constraint. [0:02:46]
 And set an arrow go up here and we do the same over this side as well with same angle. [0:02:51]
 But because I've got free blades, I'm going to just use this quadrant. [0:02:54]
 So I'm going to create two more lines now and place these connecting up to the vertical [0:03:01]
 and the horizontal like so. [0:03:05]
 And we're going to create another arc so I'm going to have an endpoint arc. [0:03:09]
 We can use the other one if I want to. [0:03:11]
 I'm going to connect up these two points and create our arc. [0:03:17]
 And we'll take the center with the arc, this one here, and place the center, [0:03:23]
 this point, and our center point, the quidstum with chara. [0:03:30]
 So we've got the starts of our blade. [0:03:32]
 I set the radius of the arc. [0:03:36]
 Use the radius and set that to 100 millimeters. [0:03:41]
 Now we can start to shape the blade. [0:03:45]
 Let's pull these over to the side, get these out of the way. [0:03:49]
 I'm going to use the fillet so this one here, sketch fillet. [0:03:53]
 I'm going to fill it off the top of this blade, like so. [0:03:57]
 And we can do the same for the bottom. [0:04:00]
 So we've got our fillets in here. [0:04:03]
 Thick escape and sets and diameter to this one. [0:04:08]
 Select it and set the radius. [0:04:11]
 Set the radius for that one. [0:04:13]
 I'm going to set this one to 30 millimeters. [0:04:15]
 I'm going to take this point and this line, [0:04:18]
 I'm going to point on object constraint. [0:04:22]
 I set this one. [0:04:25]
 I will set that to 20 millimeters. [0:04:29]
 Again taking this point and placing it upon this line. [0:04:33]
 We'll put an object constraint. [0:04:35]
 I'm going to remove this line so this one here, [0:04:37]
 I'm going to remove it now so I hit the lead. [0:04:39]
 Just to let it go, I just go into use an arc. [0:04:43]
 So I'm going to take the arc and put the room point up and place it in here. [0:04:47]
 Using these two points and creating the arc, like so. [0:04:52]
 We've got a nice arc in there. [0:04:55]
 I can adjust that. [0:04:56]
 Let's make sure this point stays on this line. [0:04:58]
 We've point on object constraint. [0:04:59]
 And we can set that where we want. [0:05:02]
 Let's create some tangency taking this arc and this arc. [0:05:05]
 And create a tangent constraint and hit OK. [0:05:09]
 So now we've got this tangent constraint in here. [0:05:11]
 I can decide where it's going to go. [0:05:14]
 Finally, let's take this arc at radius about 16 millimeters. [0:05:22]
 So we've got our fan blade. [0:05:25]
 That's it, close. [0:05:26]
 So that's to start with our fan blade and we can see how that sits in the middle. [0:05:31]
 So in the moment we've got a fan blade, [0:05:33]
 but we need to have this angled and a right around a center point. [0:05:39]
 That's still for the angle. [0:05:40]
 To do that, we're going to use a common workflow. [0:05:44]
 So I'm going to come over the part, workbench. [0:05:45]
 Now I'm going to make a sweep along a helix. [0:05:51]
 This will give me the shape to extract this from using the intersectional common. [0:05:56]
 So make sure nothing's selected. [0:05:59]
 Come out to the part and create a primitive. [0:06:02]
 So in here we have number of primitive objects, [0:06:07]
 including the helix. [0:06:09]
 And we can come in and set the radius. [0:06:13]
 Now this will be the same radius as this arc here, which is 20 millimeters. [0:06:17]
 The height will probably be the same as the connection point. [0:06:23]
 So once we put a cylinder in here to connect this up, [0:06:25]
 it's probably going to be the same height as that. [0:06:27]
 So we'll say 15 millimeters. [0:06:29]
 Next is the pitch. [0:06:33]
 And this is going to be quite high. [0:06:36]
 So for starts, I'm just going to put 10 millimeters and we're going to adjust that in a moment [0:06:41]
 and hit create. [0:06:43]
 So a helix has been created. [0:06:46]
 Now I don't adjust the helix from here. [0:06:47]
 I've always had create another one as it closed. [0:06:49]
 Click on the helix and come down and start changing. [0:06:53]
 So the pitch. [0:06:54]
 I set that to 30. [0:06:57]
 We can see how that pitches around there. [0:06:59]
 Let's go a bit further and set it to 35. [0:07:02]
 So we have this helix goes around here. [0:07:07]
 This is going to be a path to sweep something across. [0:07:11]
 So this is going to be basically the profile [0:07:14]
 for our blade. [0:07:16]
 Notice where the helix starts. [0:07:17]
 So the helix is starting at this point. [0:07:22]
 In line with the side of the blade. [0:07:24]
 If it's not in line, just click on it. [0:07:27]
 Right click, transform. [0:07:29]
 And we can rotate that around to where we want. [0:07:31]
 So now we're going to create a new sketch at this point. [0:07:37]
 That comes out this way. [0:07:38]
 Now as a number of ways to do this, we could create a sketch [0:07:41]
 based on the base plane by commos of sketcher. [0:07:44]
 And make sure nothing slatted. [0:07:47]
 Great new sketch on the x-y plane. [0:07:49]
 All we can come in and select this point of the helix. [0:07:53]
 Now sketch is going to go in a way. [0:07:55]
 So select the sketch process base bar. [0:07:57]
 And select this point of the helix. [0:07:58]
 And create a new sketch and translate. [0:08:02]
 So the origin will be translated to here. [0:08:06]
 So I'm going to create some geometry in here now. [0:08:09]
 And this is going to be a line that comes from this point outwards. [0:08:14]
 Like so, and we're going to thicken this in the part workbench. [0:08:19]
 We're a 3D offset. [0:08:21]
 I'm going to keep this line in line with these two points here. [0:08:25]
 So it comes out from this point to this point and out this way. [0:08:29]
 I'm pulling another point. [0:08:30]
 That means we can make this fully constrained by using a parallel constraint [0:08:34]
 and an extra line. [0:08:36]
 There are for ways to do it, but we just don't want this line to move. [0:08:39]
 So this is important, this point. [0:08:41]
 So what's happening is the point being projected down [0:08:45]
 and the plane is surface. [0:08:46]
 So along the same plane. [0:08:48]
 Click top and come over to the line. [0:08:53]
 Use a line constraint to this point and come in and constrain to this one. [0:08:59]
 So we've span those two points. [0:09:02]
 Now I'm going to take this line and this line [0:09:06]
 and make a parallel constraint to keep those in line. [0:09:11]
 Next, let's let the line that connects these two points [0:09:18]
 and make that construction geometry. [0:09:19]
 So this won't show up. [0:09:22]
 You can't find the construction geometry up here. [0:09:24]
 You can't sketch geometries and you find the total construction geometry. [0:09:29]
 So this will toggle if I click that game and use the same tool [0:09:33]
 then it will toggle that with construction mode. [0:09:35]
 Let's close and have a look see what we got. [0:09:37]
 So we've got this coming out this way and we've got our sketch. [0:09:41]
 It's a pressurized space part to show that. [0:09:43]
 If we sweep this along the helix, it's not going to be long enough. [0:09:46]
 So we need to make this longer. [0:09:48]
 Let's come into that sketch and set the link for this. [0:09:52]
 Pull that, sliptit, and set a length of 100mm. [0:10:01]
 And that's the same as a diameter of this circle here. [0:10:05]
 Let's hit close. [0:10:07]
 So what we've got now is we've got the blade. [0:10:09]
 We've got our profile sketch and those one line. [0:10:13]
 That's fine and we've got this helix which is going to be the path of the sweep. [0:10:19]
 That's now come over to the part we're inch and click on the part we're inch. [0:10:26]
 I'm going to come up to the part and come down to the sweep. [0:10:33]
 So this will allow us to sweep this profile along this helix. [0:10:40]
 First we need the profile which is sketch 001. [0:10:43]
 There's not the first sketch sketch 001 so it's highlighted there. [0:10:48]
 I've double click on it or press the arrow key. [0:10:52]
 We go I start to profile. [0:10:55]
 Now we click sweep path and we select the helix. [0:11:00]
 This helix here. Click done and then click OK. [0:11:05]
 We've swept that along that path. [0:11:08]
 Now we need to offset this we need to give this some thickness. [0:11:12]
 Click the sweep, cut to part and use the 3D offset tool. [0:11:18]
 We found on the toolbar here. [0:11:21]
 That's set this offset to something like 3mm. [0:11:25]
 Make sure that the fill offset is checked so we get some thickness. [0:11:30]
 We've got if we look down we've got an offset inside that is the sweep. [0:11:37]
 Notice that the sweep is still visible. [0:11:40]
 I'm going to leave it visible for the time being just to show you something that make a [0:11:43]
 fuse you when it comes to extracting out the blade from this profile. [0:11:48]
 That's what we're going to do now. [0:11:49]
 We're going to extract out that blade from the profile. [0:11:51]
 First of all we need to make some thickness for the sketch of the blade. [0:11:57]
 We need to extrude it through the sweep. [0:12:01]
 That's the strewd and extrude it around about 50mm. [0:12:07]
 We need to make sure that it goes all the way through that sweep. [0:12:13]
 So I'm looking at this now and I can see that it's gone through the bottom which is correct. [0:12:19]
 So it captures that sweep there. [0:12:21]
 And it comes all the way around here. [0:12:25]
 We've got no gaping at the top here. [0:12:31]
 In the matter of fact I'm going to take that strewd. [0:12:33]
 I'm just going to set that to 60mm. [0:12:34]
 I think forward. So we clear that. [0:12:37]
 What we're trying to do is create a common between these two surfaces. [0:12:45]
 So where they meet we need to extract out that shape from this sweep. [0:12:51]
 So now I can create a common. [0:12:53]
 Slet is strewd. [0:12:56]
 Note so only slet to the face. That's fine. [0:13:00]
 We've got the strewd to slet it up here. [0:13:01]
 Control click the sweep. [0:13:04]
 Well it's actually the offset. [0:13:06]
 Control click that. [0:13:07]
 And use this button here the intersection. [0:13:11]
 Also available from part, boolean and intersection. [0:13:16]
 So this is where the confusion can start. [0:13:19]
 We create the intersection but you see we have this here. [0:13:24]
 So we still got the original surface. [0:13:26]
 We click on it. [0:13:27]
 It's just because it's still visible. [0:13:30]
 The process space bar to hide it. [0:13:32]
 And we can come in and click on the sketch. [0:13:35]
 Process space bar on that. [0:13:36]
 And also the helix. [0:13:38]
 Process space bar on that. [0:13:39]
 So we've got our first blade. [0:13:41]
 That sits here. [0:13:43]
 But we need free of them. [0:13:46]
 Now at this point we can add filets to the blade. [0:13:49]
 But I'm just going to show you the right tools. [0:13:52]
 So if you wanted to write this, then we can come over to the draft workbench. [0:13:57]
 And make sure the grid is turned off because we don't need it. [0:14:01]
 Let's quickly save this. [0:14:04]
 Oh save as. [0:14:05]
 So now I saved. [0:14:10]
 We can go into our right and so make sure the common is selected. [0:14:14]
 This common here. [0:14:17]
 Go out to modifications. [0:14:19]
 Right tools. [0:14:20]
 And polarite. [0:14:22]
 Not circular, right? [0:14:24]
 Polarite. [0:14:24]
 We have our Polarite, but we need to modify the x, y and z coordinates. [0:14:30]
 Now if we collect reset point, it will reset the point to here. [0:14:34]
 But the minute we move off, as you can see, well, [0:14:37]
 our center of rotation has changed. [0:14:39]
 So we click reset point. [0:14:43]
 We stay over here and then set the number of elements. [0:14:47]
 And we set this. [0:14:49]
 We need free blades to set it to free. [0:14:51]
 If you come off, then we can just click reset point again. [0:14:55]
 We're going to go over the full free hundred and sixty and hit OK. [0:14:59]
 So create it those blades. [0:15:02]
 And as you can see, they sit around the center point. [0:15:06]
 So that's now great our center point. [0:15:10]
 Now there are a number of ways to do in this. [0:15:12]
 So this is the connector. [0:15:14]
 That's come over to say the part. [0:15:16]
 We can create a sketch in the center. [0:15:19]
 Or we could just add a cylinder. [0:15:21]
 And this will be the same diameter as this. [0:15:27]
 So this is 20mm. [0:15:28]
 So the diameter here. [0:15:30]
 Sorry, the radius is 20mm. [0:15:33]
 Quick on the cylinder. [0:15:36]
 Come down to the radius and set that to 20mm. [0:15:39]
 And that's how a look we need to set the height. [0:15:43]
 So the height. [0:15:45]
 Remember back to our helix. [0:15:47]
 We set that to 15mm. [0:15:49]
 So that's how we'll see what 15mm gives us. [0:15:51]
 So that's looking all right. [0:15:53]
 We may need to move this down. [0:15:55]
 We can either right click transform it or we're coming to the placement. [0:15:58]
 Position along the z axis. [0:16:01]
 And move this down to where we want. [0:16:05]
 So they connect up. [0:16:08]
 Correctly. [0:16:10]
 So we've got that in there. [0:16:12]
 So at this point, we would do a boolean against the [0:16:18]
 array and the cylinder or control slightly in them. [0:16:21]
 And come up to part, [0:16:23]
 boolean and union. [0:16:27]
 So those union together. [0:16:29]
 So those union together and that creates a fusion. [0:16:32]
 If you have problems and they don't fuse properly, just make the [0:16:40]
 cylinder slightly bigger. [0:16:41]
 And we can do that in here actually by clicking on the cylinder [0:16:44]
 and setting our radius, which is down in the bottom, [0:16:49]
 to say 23. [0:16:53]
 That's grown that and it's all marked by the fused into place. [0:16:58]
 I'm going to leave that at 20. [0:17:00]
 So we've got our fan blade, but I want these edges. [0:17:10]
 I see filleted. [0:17:12]
 So what do we do? We've gone all the way to this point. [0:17:15]
 Well, I'm going to take the fusion just to leave that. [0:17:18]
 So that is me on array and inside that array, we've got common and open up the [0:17:25]
 common and we've got this through and the offset. [0:17:29]
 So the array takes the common and arrays it. [0:17:34]
 So you can see here the base is the common. [0:17:37]
 But I want to add some fillets onto this common. [0:17:40]
 So if I click on the array and press the space bar and bring back the common, [0:17:45]
 it's not coming back. It's not showing it. [0:17:47]
 So I could delete the array, which will now show the common. [0:17:53]
 And we're coming and come up to make sure nothing's let it come out to part. [0:18:01]
 But it's flipped its shape. [0:18:05]
 Now if I selected something, this will be selected in here. [0:18:09]
 But we can just drop this down and click on the common. [0:18:13]
 And I could select the edges. So that's let the edges that we want. [0:18:18]
 Actually, the slip faces that faces and click on this face and work our way around. [0:18:25]
 So I'm adding the faces that I want and this word the two edges, [0:18:30]
 either side. [0:18:30]
 And finally this one. [0:18:37]
 Now the strewd will be part of the sweep, which is also part of the offset. [0:18:46]
 So we'll be looking at the offset sides, which is three millimeters. [0:18:49]
 So one millimeter each side will be fine. [0:18:53]
 Here, okay, we'll get this edge here. [0:18:56]
 So as long as the two don't add up, then we won't get a problem with our fillet. [0:19:02]
 So now we can take that and array that back over in the draft level of inch. [0:19:07]
 So instead of arraying the common, we'll be arraying the fillet. [0:19:11]
 So click the fillet, modifications, [0:19:14]
 write-ups and polar array. [0:19:18]
 Set that to three and reset the points and hit okay. [0:19:26]
 So we got that. [0:19:28]
 The final step to this again is to take the array, which is this one. [0:19:34]
 Make sure we click the array. [0:19:36]
 And control click the center and back over in the part web edge. [0:19:41]
 We'll use the boolean again to part boolean and union those together as one. [0:19:49]
 So one more step that we may want to do with this model is change the picture of these blades. [0:19:54]
 Now as you can see, the picture of the blades follows the helix. [0:19:58]
 There is an option on the sweep that we can make this more flowing. [0:20:04]
 So it follows a different route. [0:20:06]
 So if you want to change this to make it a little bit different, [0:20:10]
 let's come back into the array. [0:20:13]
 Look at the fillet. [0:20:15]
 Look at the common underneath and then back into our offset. [0:20:21]
 How are we looking for? [0:20:22]
 Here's the sweep. [0:20:23]
 If we look at the sweep and come down, we've got this for an A. [0:20:27]
 And that's set to force at the moment. [0:20:31]
 If we set this to true and click off everything will recompute. [0:20:37]
 And we get a different alignment for the blades. [0:20:41]
 So as you can see, the profile has been aligned against the helix. [0:20:49]
 But we have this kind of pitch slash twist to this blade, which may be a fact that you want. [0:20:56]
 This is a fronay option in the sweep. [0:21:00]
 This is detailed in the freecat wicket for the part sweep. [0:21:04]
 And it's this fronay option here. [0:21:06]
 And it controls how the profile orientation changes as it follows along the sweeping path. [0:21:13]
 So if you want to know more about fronay, we can have a look on the wicket just here. [0:21:18]
 And it actually does mention about helixes about profile creep on here. [0:21:24]
