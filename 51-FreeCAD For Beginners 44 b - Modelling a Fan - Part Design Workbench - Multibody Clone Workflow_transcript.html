===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners 44 b - Modelling a Fan - Part Design Workbench - Multibody Clone Workflow =====
 I have one and welcome to the channel and welcome to another episode of the Learning [0:00:03]
 Freak Have For Beginners. We created this fan in the part workbench and now we're [0:00:08]
 going to look at the similar workflow in the part design. Now it must be stressed there [0:00:12]
 are multiple workflows of creating such a model in the part design and also in the part. [0:00:17]
 We're going to be looking at quite different workflows from the previous one. We could [0:00:22]
 be using the cloning workflow for this and there is a reason for this and that's because [0:00:27]
 of the array in of additive and subtractive features and the mutations of doing this [0:00:32]
 with Boolean at this time of speaking. We can do it with subtractive relative feature but I'm [0:00:37]
 going to show you the cloning workflow for this one and also how to utilize that cloning workflow [0:00:42]
 to your best advantage allowing to modify these blades just by editing one body. So I hope [0:00:49]
 you enjoy this channel, hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a look at this technique. [0:00:54]

 and that's at patreon.com, 4-sash-mango jelly solutions. Links can be found in the channel header [0:01:20]
 on the about page or in the descriptions of these videos. So the part design workflow is somewhat [0:01:26]
 different to the part workflow, we're creating this object and one of the reasons being is that [0:01:31]
 we can't have multiple bodies in there so we have to be careful when we start writing. [0:01:36]
 Also we've got different helix tools as well. So if I opened up my original fan which I've [0:01:45]
 done in the part workbench and we're break this down and delete some of the fusions and the [0:01:53]
 senders etc. I'm just delete the cylinder. This array won't actually work in the part design because [0:02:02]
 it creates a multi-body object. Part design doesn't allow multi-body objects that'd be [0:02:07]
 connected together to it to be careful of that. So this creates a much different workflow. So that's [0:02:13]
 getting to that workflow now. That's close this fan. The closed all and we're creating a new document [0:02:24]
 come over to the part design workbench and we're going to create our first body which is going [0:02:30]
 to be the blade. It's going to be the same so create a body, create a sketch, you're going to look [0:02:35]
 on the x-y plane looking down on that and we're going to use this quadrant here because we build [0:02:41]
 in free blades and we'll get span them across that circle so they're nice and even. [0:02:46]
 First of all that's great our circle and this may not be the same dimensions as what we have before. [0:02:53]
 So this one is going to be a radius of 20mm. We need another circle [0:03:04]
 which is going to be the radius of 100mm and this is the start of our fan blade. [0:03:21]
 So now we need some lines which connect up. I'm using a slightly different workflow here. [0:03:30]
 I'm using a subtractive workflow so I'm going to create the lines and connect those up. [0:03:35]
 Proofs are created these with ox and then we can create the trim between these so I'm going to [0:03:43]
 trim away all these. These two just leave in those there. [0:03:49]
 So we've got our arc and our lines. They're not connected so I'm going to take this point [0:03:58]
 and this line point to logic constraint and do the same with this point and this line. [0:04:04]
 We're going to logic constraint and we're just trim using a trend tool, trim away this circle [0:04:13]
 here so we've got this. So that was a different way of doing it in the parts workflow we used [0:04:18]
 ox. Totally out of you I used a subtractive method of creating this shape. So now I'm going to hit [0:04:24]
 a scale to go mouse point back and add the fillets between these two and the same on this side this [0:04:32]
 side and this side and we'll set one side this side and a radius of about 20mm and this side [0:04:43]
 and a radius of about 15. So we're going to our fan blade and that's close that and now [0:04:54]
 in our model we'll have a body with a sketch with him here. I'm going to right click and rename that [0:04:59]
 to fan blade. We haven't pad this we're going to now create a profile to subtract this away. [0:05:12]
 So let's create a new body and we've in a new sketch. This time we're going to create a side profile [0:05:21]
 along the except plane. Now the reason why we do this is because we've got to add some thickness. [0:05:27]
 We have to create that thickness within our sketch. That's poor in some geometry so I'm going to [0:05:31]
 use this point here but we won't be able to pull that in because it comes from another body. [0:05:37]
 I can close out because the new body is active the one that we're creating this profile in [0:05:44]
 it means I can come into the fan blade so we'll have a fan blade here and create a sub-shaped [0:05:52]
 binder so I'll this point or this line and use the subject binder or part design creates such [0:06:04]
 a binder and that brings up binder in here. So it's creating a link between these two [0:06:09]
 circum reference geometry and here. Let's go back into this sketch. First of all I'm going to [0:06:16]
 come into the model, click on this sketch here and press the space bar so we don't get confused. [0:06:21]
 That hides the sketch but we still can see our binders in there. Now that's using Port [0:06:29]
 geometry tool and find that point so we can see it just there on that line, that point just there [0:06:37]
 and the actual line, the subject binder runs this way. That's just pulling anyway. [0:06:42]
 So we've got that there so we're going to create our profile. Now it's up to you what you want to [0:06:48]
 use, we could use the slot, we could use a rectangle and I'm just going to go for standard rectangle. [0:06:55]
 Let's come in and create our shape. Now I'll create this shape here. I'm going to use [0:07:03]
 these two points and this point are made in symmetrical. Now we're such a distance so this distance [0:07:12]
 is going to be the radius. Now if we think about it we've got 20 millimeters from here [0:07:19]
 so we can set this to 80 like so. Set some point [0:07:26]
 for email. So we have that there. Now if I come into the fan blade and look at the sketch [0:07:39]
 and see that this actually encapsulates all of this blade so what's going to happen is we're [0:07:47]
 going to sweep this along the heel at this way and do a common workflow so doing an intersection [0:07:53]
 between our sweep and our padded blade so we're just looking to make sure that's in place. [0:07:59]
 That's all good. Let's go to task and hit close and one going to do is rename this body. [0:08:06]
 Right click rename on the call this sweep the body. [0:08:14]
 So now we've got our profile. We've got the binder which we're going to press the space bond [0:08:22]
 just do make it invisible because we don't need that. I'm going to use this profile [0:08:28]
 for the profile sketch. 3-0 that's a profile. We've the additive helix. Now we've got to think [0:08:38]
 about the height of this blade as well and I'm going to go for 15 millimeters so when this connects [0:08:46]
 up we're going to have a 15 millimeter connect in here. The reason why we've got to think about the [0:08:51]
 height is because the helix is going to ask us about the height. The click profile sketch and click [0:08:59]
 the additive helix. As cancelled up and show you where that is in the menu so profile [0:09:06]
 part design is a additive feature and additive helix. So as you can see at the moment we've got [0:09:16]
 a helix that will it's way too high. Go over to left. Let's change the mode so we got pitch [0:09:25]
 height angle. I want to deal with the height and the turns. The reason why I want to deal with the [0:09:32]
 height and the turns is because I know the height of my blade is going to be 15 millimeters and [0:09:39]
 I know the turns is going to be basically one of those coordinates or near enough. So let's go [0:09:45]
 height and turns. I'd 15 millimeters. Now the turns at the moment it's free turns. We want it [0:09:57]
 one single quadrant so this is a percentage or a fraction so 0.25. Might go a little bit more [0:10:05]
 and capture that blade and we have that there so you can see that's actually [0:10:13]
 created that here. And it's almost. It looks at the same as that blade. We just haven't got [0:10:20]
 the first one in here. Now we could, so you fill it these edges and create this blade if we [0:10:26]
 wanted to. That's enough of why we're doing it. But we're going to go along the same workflows [0:10:32]
 that we used in the part workbench and pad this up and create an intersection. That's close at [0:10:38]
 by here okay and we've got our helix already to go. I'll get coming to the fan blade now and what [0:10:48]
 I'm going to do is right click and toggle the active body because I'm going to deal with this sketch. [0:10:53]
 If I try to pad this without the active body toggled let's toggle the active body of [0:10:59]
 everyone so this one is actually now and coming to the fan blade and click on the sketch [0:11:04]
 and hit the pad it's saying well we can't do it because the bodies don't active. [0:11:10]
 I say okay click on the fan blade right click to that body it will show in bold. [0:11:18]
 Now click on the sketch and create the pad. See it's pad in upwards we can create this as [0:11:28]
 symmetrical so we're looking to cover this whole sweep so when we're screwed up if I screwed up say [0:11:38]
 15 millimeters then it's not going to cover that because we've got this symmetrical to playing [0:11:46]
 so we need to keep going now I'm just replacing a 60 just to make sure that we cover all this [0:11:55]
 sweep don't worry about the edges because we're dealing with those within the intersection. [0:12:01]
 So now that's encapsulated we can see it's basically really nice and hug in this shape [0:12:10]
 I see okay but we don't have to worry about how close the fit this is because we're going to [0:12:16]
 do an intersection as long as we cover the pad with the sweep we should be okay so it's coming out [0:12:24]
 at the top coming out at the bottom and we're all good to go. Now it shouldn't matter which way around [0:12:29]
 we have these when we do our boot we just make sure nothing's selected and create the booting. [0:12:35]
 Click add body the active body is made invisible. Click add body and click the current [0:12:47]
 body that you see on screen at the moment the fused drop this down and go comment so we've created our [0:12:54]
 blade like so so we've got that there with a booting workflow. I see it okay [0:13:02]
 so we have the booting blade in there inside the fan blade this one here so we got our blade [0:13:10]
 but we need to rotate this and clone this in some kind of rain or cloning workflow [0:13:19]
 to create the additional plays they're going to go around the center. [0:13:23]
 Before we go ahead that's save our project so far save us and going to call this part [0:13:32]
 of the time fan and save up. Now for the eagle dive view you can see a problem here in that we've [0:13:42]
 got this checkmark. If I come out to edit refresh we get this dependency error and the document contains [0:13:50]
 dependency cycles. I hit yes then that still needs for confusion. Why is this? Well it's all to do with [0:13:59]
 it for coming to the actual sweep and I've got this binder here is all to do with this sub shape [0:14:05]
 binder this one here we created a binder between the sketch and the sweep body this one here [0:14:13]
 and that pulled in that binder bind in the sketch into the new body we then create a Boolean [0:14:21]
 which basically places the sweep body inside the fan body so we've got a connection from the fan [0:14:28]
 body to the sweep body then back again with the Boolean and that creates that circle dependency there. [0:14:35]
 How do we solve it? It is actually quite simple in that well with the Boolean if we're taking [0:14:41]
 it from another body then the binder will cause this because it's created this dependency [0:14:47]
 the circular dependency we can delete that binder because we don't need it anymore and no it's [0:14:52]
 got reference to the following sketch sketch 001 that yes then that dependency disappears and [0:15:00]
 I can double click the profile and all we used that binder is to make sure that this was this distance [0:15:08]
 away and well we just need to add some distance in here between these two points. [0:15:14]
 Place a distance of 20mm and we let another constraint between these two [0:15:25]
 and make the spectacle so that's soul set issue there we've got no dependency we've got no [0:15:33]
 recompusion that will just keep going round and round and round and will never fulfill the recompute [0:15:39]
 I'll be doing a video about that in the future and the tools that you can use to find those types of [0:15:44]
 errors so we've got the part design fan blade we need to array this in a circle now we can't use [0:15:52]
 the Polaroid well because that's cancel out and coming into one that will to Polaroid this Boolean [0:15:59]
 if I try to use a Polaroid and we'll place it in the fan body it's going to not allow us to do this [0:16:06]
 because it can only transform additive or subtractive features there is enough of solution [0:16:14]
 well there's multiple solutions we're going to go down a clone workflow so the one I want to clone [0:16:21]
 is basically this fan body and we'll go clone this twice quick on the fan body come up to the [0:16:27]
 part design and create a clone and we're going to do it again so we've got this body here and you can see [0:16:35]
 if I highlight that it's actually sitting on top of that one we've in it so click on fan body again [0:16:41]
 part design create a clone or we use the sheep icon on the toolbar that's create a clone [0:16:49]
 of that body so anything that changes with the fan body will change within the clone and that comes [0:16:55]
 in handy when we have the fillets so now we've got those fan blades then we can manipulate them in [0:17:01]
 freely space so we can click on one of the bodies come down to the placement and come down to the angle [0:17:07]
 we're working a 45 degree sections we need to figure out the placement of these blades [0:17:12]
 we'll have the rotation of these blades so if we pull up our calculator if we think of we've got 45 [0:17:18]
 degrees of blade and we've got three blades so we've got 105 degrees taken up by the blades [0:17:25]
 we have 360 degree rotation minus 1355 this is 225 of basically blank space we divide that by [0:17:38]
 3 to get the placement of the blades the spacing between that's 75 degrees so I can place these [0:17:45]
 I'll take in the first one place it at the angle 45 degrees and then plus the 75 onto that so [0:17:54]
 we can just do some mass in here and hit enter 120 let's take our next one so this one will be 45 [0:18:04]
 times 2 it ends up so nice degrees and then we plus the 75 times 2 plus 75 and once more plus 75 [0:18:15]
 and that gets us into the position that we want so we have our fan blades now we need a center part [0:18:26]
 to combine these all together so we've got the top we can see the circle in here so we need to [0:18:33]
 create our 20 millimeters of radius in there and we're going to do that in a new body so this is the [0:18:40]
 part so that's creating a new body creating a new body and let's just rename these [0:18:47]
 now we're rename this one to connection point so now we'll go to that connection point that's [0:19:09]
 great something in here now we can do this will sketch I'm going to use an added supremative [0:19:14]
 so these here the yellow ones which are additive bread are destructive and I'm going to just use [0:19:21]
 an add cylinder in here or we can come up to part design great add a primitive and add it [0:19:29]
 cylinder that's added the cylinder to there the heights well this is going to be 15 [0:19:37]
 but we need to add on say 3 millimeters for the profile width so 18 millimeter the radius I set this to 20 [0:19:45]
 and we can see what we're going here so we've got those added in here [0:19:52]
 and if we zoom in we can see that well we need to bring this down so this cylinder needs to move [0:20:01]
 down so it attaches up the top or is in line with this top now if we look down we can see the [0:20:08]
 attachment and it's same selecting we haven't actually selected anything in the oven selected anything [0:20:12]
 and what we want to do is select the top plane so this xy plane if I click on that you can see the [0:20:20]
 plane xy plane has been selected it's placed it upon that plane therefore that will open up [0:20:28]
 these attachment offsets these will be disabled and I can move this in the Z direction so for [0:20:34]
 come in and try and select anything from the screen otherwise your cylinder will be attached to it [0:20:39]
 and well we have to do is click on the plane again so that's do that if I select that you can see well [0:20:49]
 I've attached it now to the plane so what we do is just leave these out [0:20:53]
 I like them to leave them and we're back to reference one click reference one so it's saying [0:20:59]
 selecting and that's let the plane again so this one you attachments become active and we can move this [0:21:10]
 in the Z direction and we'll move this down until it's in line with the top [0:21:18]
 so minus 1.5 and click off and you can see well that's more less at the top [0:21:29]
 and if we look down the bottom it's connected to the bottom now so that's all okay so we're [0:21:37]
 coming to the top here okay and now we've got the fan and the connection point now this point [0:21:49]
 we can create a sketch of upon here new sketch along that cylinder and add a connection [0:21:55]
 I should place a circle in there it closed and then pocket that [0:22:02]
 go through all okay so just done quick hold through that these are at the moment individual parts [0:22:12]
 and we're going to boolean these all together we need an active body so we must make sure that [0:22:19]
 we do believe that nothing's selected so just click on some blank space the connection point [0:22:24]
 is the active body it's embold so that will be made invisible when I use a boolean so [0:22:31]
 I go out to part design boolean operations see it finishes and we can click add body [0:22:38]
 and click display and then move around and click and add body notice the blade disappears [0:22:46]
 displayed add body once more last blade quick that we've got few selected so they will [0:22:55]
 fuse together and we hit okay now what we have is that if I collapse all these up [0:23:03]
 we have this boolean inside here and we've created a fan using a part design workflow [0:23:13]
 which involves cloning and rotating the blades and using a boolean infuse with the individual bodies [0:23:19]
 so before we go let's show you a little tip regarding the clone workflow and this was in one [0:23:25]
 of the previous lanythry cathartic in the tutorials we've used clones in there and the boolean [0:23:30]
 is basically we've taken the original clone some booleans together we can be a little bit more clever [0:23:35]
 about this let's just delete that boolean to release those blades and we've got the fan blades [0:23:43]
 now there's one missing because the boolean isn't shown to participate on that [0:23:47]
 that one there sweet body because we've created a boolean common with that one [0:23:53]
 now we've created clone so this is a clone and the same as these they've all been cloned [0:24:03]
 from the original so there's a cloning side there and it tells you what cloning is it's in the body [0:24:08]
 because it's on the body that means that anything underneath that body to fan body blade [0:24:14]
 if that original body changes then everything else changes for example if I had a fillet to this [0:24:21]
 the fillet will be applied to these two when we added all these to a boolean so we used the connection [0:24:27]
 point as the active body and boolean in the two clones and the original then we stopped any [0:24:39]
 edits to let boolean afterwards without fring them from the structure that's clone the fan [0:24:45]
 blade again so we're going to take this fan blade and clone it so this is fan blade 1 so [0:24:53]
 coming here fan blade 1 and I've actually called this fan blade that's rename that to fan blade [0:25:04]
 now we go fan blade 2 so it's almost like a plan this I've got one two and free now which [0:25:10]
 other clones and the one that's just called fan blade is just the original so these are all cloned [0:25:16]
 we're going to do now is I've got the active body as the connection point and we're going to [0:25:24]
 come in and use the boolean and that's make sure that the original fan blade is invisible [0:25:33]
 I present a spacebar on that and let's come back to the tasks click add body and we're going to [0:25:39]
 select all of the clones so I'm adding all of the clones in like so it's used nice together and here [0:25:46]
 okay so now we've got inside the boolean all the clones but we've got our original fan but [0:25:57]
 blade up here the fan blade body what this means for bring that on the back we can get to [0:26:06]
 our blade let's just hide this one press spacebar anything I do to this will affect the other [0:26:14]
 blades because this is original the clones sit in the hidden connection point so if I come in [0:26:23]
 add a fillet upon here so I'm going to click this edge a quick fillet so we need to make this the [0:26:31]
 active body click on the fan blade right click toggle active body now that's use the fillet [0:26:40]
 click on that edge and use the fillet that's place a fillet around that edge there so I [0:26:46]
 fillet it at that top edge let's add another edge so click add and we're at this edge as well [0:26:53]
 and we're going to increase this to an impact to one so it takes so we've created the fillet [0:27:04]
 around there all the way around there by just selecting that edge reason why two didn't take up [0:27:11]
 well if we add two for one side and two for the other side it makes four but for this is free so [0:27:18]
 it won't take so it has to be smaller than the depth of the item that you're filleting if I hit okay [0:27:25]
 the fillet has taken that's hide the fan blade and bring back the connection point [0:27:34]
 and fan itself and we look around and the fillet has taken on all the fan blades all the clones [0:27:42]
 so it's showing that anything we do is the original gets reflected in all the clones [0:27:48]
 this makes our life easier even if we take the sections out of here with some like a pocket [0:27:53]
 it will be reflected in each of those blades that have been cloned from the original [0:27:59]
 so I'm going to leave that one with you as a quick tip and in some more of using one of our [0:28:06]
 other workflows in this workflow and you can go back and see that it's in the earlier part of [0:28:11]
