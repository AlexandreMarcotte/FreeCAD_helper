===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners 45 - Mirroring off centre features - Part Design Workbench - Datum Plane =====
 I have one walk on the channel and welcome to another episode of the Lennie FreeCalf [0:00:04]
 for begins. Today we can be looking at mirroring but mirroring over a reference so [0:00:10]
 a normal mirror we actually mirror something like this pad and it will mirror over the [0:00:16]
 sketch vertical or horizontal axis or we can use the base place. Now you can see [0:00:22]
 that we are centered here so if I mirror this pad as standard it will come over here [0:00:28]
 and cause an error. I have actually mirror this to this side here. We're also going to [0:00:34]
 be learning how to mirror say this feature to here where our center and mirror point is [0:00:42]
 actually along this way. So let's have a look at mirroring over a reference with freecat. [0:00:48]

 on the about page or in the descriptions of these videos. So for this tutorial we're going to be [0:01:21]
 in the part design and we're going to be looking at the part design mirror. That starts off with [0:01:28]
 a very simple body and sketch. So I'm going to create a body and create a sketch along the x-y plane [0:01:35]
 and here okay. We're just going to look at a mirror and see how it works. I'm going to create a [0:01:43]
 square in here using the Rattangle tool. It's great. Let's go to mouse point back and make these two [0:01:50]
 points. Let's let them and then select in the center point and then use the symmetry. [0:01:56]
 That's made those two points so much equal to the center. I'm going to take these two lines [0:02:02]
 and make the meacore. That's bringing these out a bit and set some distance. This is in here [0:02:11]
 or say 50 millimeters. So I created a simple shape. I'm going to hit close and we're going to [0:02:18]
 pad this. What we're going to do is create a face on top of here with a feature that we're going to mirror. [0:02:24]
 We're going to learn how that mirror works and then what happens when we want to do something [0:02:28]
 it like an offset mirror. I set this to 5mm and hit okay. Now I'm going to create a feature on top of [0:02:36]
 here by clicking on the face. Click once. Don't double click. It was with slits. The whole pad. [0:02:41]
 See if I double click to let the whole pad. So just click once in that face and create a sketch. [0:02:47]
 So I'm going to place just a circle in this top left hand section here. You notice that [0:02:57]
 because we've got a symmetrical then we've got the X and the Y running this way [0:03:03]
 and we will be mirroring over this axis here. So we'd always need to mirror over plane or [0:03:14]
 a axis of a sketch. I'm going to hit a scale. I'm not going to get strain this but I'm going to add [0:03:19]
 some diameter. So I'm going to add some diameter in here of 10mm. So when we go for a mirror [0:03:28]
 well that's first crate. Let's say a pocket with this around about 3mm in depth and here okay. [0:03:37]
 So we go back there. The first thing I'm going to do is come up to the view and toggle all the [0:03:43]
 axis cross because this gives us an idea of where the center is. Now when we move mirror we have to mirror [0:03:50]
 over the center of the plane or the sketch. And that's when we start getting problems when we're [0:03:56]
 using so part of the sketch but in another section that's say we will over here and create a circle [0:04:03]
 here and I just want to mirror it to say to here. That's how I look at the mirror first. So we got [0:04:08]
 our pocket and we come over to the model. Click on the pocket the feature that we want to mirror [0:04:15]
 and use the mirror. The mirror on the toolbar or can't do part design. It's a pattern, [0:04:22]
 supply pattern and mirror it. And you can see that we're mirroring over this plane here. [0:04:28]
 This Y's airplane well saying that we're actually mirroring over the sketch so the vertical [0:04:35]
 sketch axis that runs this way and the horizontal one runs this way. Remember sketches are [0:04:41]
 2D object so we only have two axes and if we change this to a different axis let's go for the Y's [0:04:52]
 airplane. So base Y's said we get the same and if we change this to base [0:04:58]
 X airplane you see the same there. If we change this to the X Y plane then nothing's happened. [0:05:07]
 That's changed this back to the vertical sketch axis. So we got that there and you can see with [0:05:14]
 the toggle axis crossed and we got the axis here you can see how it's been mirrored over there. [0:05:19]
 So for the second demonstration we're going to create something different. When the part design [0:05:25]
 we create a body, create a sketch again on the X Y plane and here okay. [0:05:31]
 I'm going to be using the poly line so this one here and we create an L-shaped sketch in here [0:05:39]
 something like that. And we'll come up and connect up like so. We got the old constraints in [0:05:53]
 so we're getting these vertical and horizontal constraints already added. Let's give it some distance [0:06:01]
 something like this and make sure that these are all equal and this one here has a height of about [0:06:17]
 50mm. So we've got this shape and I'm not worried about these lines here because we're going to be using [0:06:26]
 a reference to allow us to create say a reference across here to mirror across this part [0:06:34]
 or reference across here to mirror from this point to this point. So it doesn't matter where this [0:06:41]
 sets because we don't need these. Let's just put it down here somewhere and hit close. [0:06:47]
 So we've got this here that's pad that with a fragment of the pad and select the top face and [0:06:57]
 create a sketch upon it. So you may have sent a geometry around here but you may have a feature [0:07:02]
 that's over this side that you want to create mirrors across this here. So that's create our first [0:07:10]
 circle. So this circle here is going to be mirrored and this is going to create a pad or a pocket [0:07:17]
 that's going for a pad of around about 3mm. So we've got that if I try to mirror that [0:07:27]
 using the view to go like this cross well what's going to happen it's going to mirror from here [0:07:35]
 across the axis to over this side or if we select sketch axis, [0:07:42]
 double click that sketch it's going to do the same so I ask sketch axis. The vertical [0:07:49]
 and horizontal is going to go across this side and causes an issue and we can see that last [0:07:56]
 let's in the pad that's why not click the pad and using the mirror and we can see it's mirrored over [0:08:04]
 here even if we go along the Y's airplane then it's not going to work. That's cancel that. [0:08:11]
 So we need to mirror it over something we can't mirror it over the planes because if we do that [0:08:17]
 well it will sit on this side because it's mirrored over there. So we need a reference to mirror this [0:08:24]
 over and we can use that to plane which sits here that and data to whether you want to call it [0:08:32]
 that's one here. To use it there's two ways we can either pre-slat the features on this item [0:08:41]
 or we can just click on the plane itself also available from part design. [0:08:47]
 Great that's a great that's a plane that's been added to the screen and it's got no reference [0:08:56]
 because nothing is selected. So to actually get it going across here I need to step some kind of [0:09:03]
 reference. Now the use are over edges, vertices or faces. So for instance I can take [0:09:12]
 this edge you can see that this has changed my one and we've got selecting now next box [0:09:18]
 and then select this edge and that's placed it across those edges and we can change the connection [0:09:27]
 the inertia to free plane by free points we can rotate etc etc but this is not working for me [0:09:36]
 this is not placing it as the center if I chose a vertex then we can do that. We're going to come in [0:09:43]
 and delete the top one reference to we moved out was because reference one's no longer used [0:09:48]
 that's delete that one as well. So we've got no references in here. Reference one button must click on [0:09:56]
 that make sure it's saying that in. Zoom right in and select the vertex and come out. [0:10:03]
 Let's go over to this side now we can see reference two make sure that's saying slat in. Zoom right in [0:10:11]
 and select the vertex. If you select an edge or a face and don't worry just come in to [0:10:20]
 delete it out make sure it's a selecting going and set that up. Now you can see that plane sits in the [0:10:28]
 middle. That's hit okay. So we've got our plane what do we do now what's the same? Select the pad [0:10:36]
 part design apply pattern mirrored. Now instead of mirroring it across plane here [0:10:47]
 and you're these we need to select the reference so select reference and we select [0:10:55]
 but that's simply and we get that going across these two here. So we have that going across here [0:11:04]
 and if I hit okay you can see it sit in at the right point. This can be changed. [0:11:11]
 So for instance I've mirrored across this side that's if we can get it over to this side [0:11:18]
 so do that we double click the datum plane and I didn't go into these attachment mode so [0:11:25]
 we can see the attachment mode is set to inertia two free and there's a number of others in here [0:11:31]
 free pad will pick the most common one that you would want but you can change it within here. [0:11:38]
 Also we've got attachment offsets and rotations as well. So that's changed this so I [0:11:47]
 take away this one let's delete that and also delete this one as well and reference one let's [0:11:55]
 select that and select this point in here. If you get the hand just click off into the bank space [0:12:02]
 make sure that's set in zoom right into to make it easier on yourself and select the vertex. [0:12:08]
 Reference two click that and come in and select the other vertex so this one in here. [0:12:20]
 So we've got both vertices selected. Nusher two free it's not working there so that's try the [0:12:29]
 one and where we can see well it's not really working so if we get to this stage it's not [0:12:36]
 really working and it's not selecting the right point then we can use some rotation and I'm going to [0:12:44]
 flip this around the y this way here so we can rotate this like so and get this positioned [0:12:52]
 to where we want so 90 degrees this way. So we've got that intersecting these two points [0:13:03]
 when you're happy here okay it looks like it hasn't worked but we can see a tick [0:13:11]
 but that's in plane. Go onto edit and hit refresh and that's mirrored [0:13:17]
 percept plane onto the other side. Let's take a look at another example where we're using a model [0:13:25]
 that's over two planes so go in this way and up. So let's have a look at another example so I [0:13:33]
 hope it more complex. We've been able to put in the part design that's creating new sketch [0:13:38]
 and this time I'm going to go up all the different planes and that's choose the XZ plane. [0:13:46]
 I'm looking to create with the polyline a L-shate geometry in here so we're just creating this L-shate [0:13:57]
 geometry and notice where I'm placing it I'm placing it across these axes. [0:14:06]
 Titscape and that'll get the last point back and I'm going to place a horizontal [0:14:11]
 constraint to go into here and make these two [0:14:13]
 and this axis here symmetrical and the same for these two and this axis make those symmetrical [0:14:24]
 so much of constraint make these two equal [0:14:28]
 like so and we'll make these two equal as well. So we've got this L-shate we just put it out a little [0:14:40]
 and add some dimension so this length just connect one at 15 millimeters. So we've got that there [0:14:49]
 pull this in so we've got this L-shate that's closed that and what I'm going to do is zoom out a [0:14:59]
 little take the sketch and we'll pad it by 60mm so we have this here now I'm going to add a sketch [0:15:13]
 on here new sketch so on that face now and we'll add a feature on here so I want to mirror [0:15:23]
 this feature this slot once I've taken that and created let's say a pad on there [0:15:31]
 by 2mm I want to mirror this same feature on this side so what do I do because if I mirror across [0:15:40]
 this center line it's not going to take effect it's going to sit out here I've taken that pad [0:15:48]
 we use the mirror you can see it's gone red and one transformed shape does not intersect the [0:15:55]
 support so that's not going to work well this time we're going to use the datron plane in slightly [0:16:02]
 different way we're going to press that this edge coming to the inside and control [0:16:09]
 select this edge here I'll select the face so keep the control down, select again and then select [0:16:18]
 this edge and I'll click that face and try to get the right one and that's zoom in like how life [0:16:26]
 is here so we'll select it both those edges if you have problems selecting them then we can [0:16:34]
 actually increase the pad edge size so coming to the body look at the view and we got draw and style [0:16:44]
 line color and what we should be able to do is get to the line width and that's bring this out to say [0:16:51]
 for that's better now we should be able to select these easier and that's that this edge that's [0:17:00]
 made that a lot easier and come in control select this edge here so those two are selected [0:17:07]
 come on to the top and create that's in plane that has intersected through those two edges [0:17:19]
 which is perfect you can see we've got h2 h17 here okay now what happens when I mirror this across [0:17:29]
 this datron plane it's going to mirror this feature on this side so that's let the feature pad [0:17:36]
 use the mirror it sees over here at the moment come on to plane drop this down select reference [0:17:47]
 and then come up and click and that's some plane and we've mirrored across this edge here [0:17:56]
 and the feature is now on this side so that's an introduction of how to use a datron plane with [0:18:04]
 the mirror when you use it for reference very powerful very practical now hope that's help with your [0:18:11]
