===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners - 46 - Sketcher Reference Constraints. What are they and how to use them. =====
 I have one and welcome to another episode of the Learning Free CAD for Beginner Series. [0:00:05]
 In this tutorial we're going to be looking at reference constraints. [0:00:09]
 What they are and what they can be useful. [0:00:12]
 So I hope you enjoy these videos and let's have a look at this type of constraint. [0:00:16]

 So what is reference geometry? [0:00:48]
 I mean free CAD, 0.21, but the same concept is in previous versions as well. [0:00:56]
 I've come into the sketcher and I'm going to build a sketch in here. [0:01:01]
 And this is going to be a simple sketch. [0:01:04]
 So I'm going to create a new document on the xy plane and here okay. [0:01:08]
 And I'm going to create a simple box in here. [0:01:12]
 Here's a sketch that I'm asked on a back or right mouse button [0:01:17]
 and we'll set the e-cool with the equality constraint [0:01:22]
 and we're going to use some symmetry with this point and this point against this point here [0:01:29]
 using the symmetric constraint. [0:01:32]
 I'm now going to set a length in here [0:01:35]
 using the length. [0:01:37]
 And we'll set this to 100 mm. [0:01:41]
 You notice that the length itself has turned our sketch the green so it's fully constrained. [0:01:47]
 We can see over the left-hand side it's saying for the constraint. [0:01:50]
 And this is known as a datum or datum constraint. [0:01:53]
 We can name this constraint if we want. [0:01:55]
 Let's just hit okay. [0:01:57]
 So we've got the 100 mm in here. [0:02:00]
 If we looked our left and come down we can see our constraint is in here. [0:02:06]
 If I double click the constraint and change this to reference [0:02:12]
 you see that we have an under-constrained sketch of one degree of freedom. [0:02:18]
 This means that change that constraint to reference [0:02:21]
 hasn't fully constrained the sketch and it can move. [0:02:25]
 Watch the reference constraint. [0:02:27]
 So if I shrink this box our reference constraint changes [0:02:31]
 and reflects the size of our new box size. [0:02:35]
 Why is this useful? [0:02:37]
 Well that's think of a sketch that becomes over-constrained. [0:02:40]
 For that we need some kind of application. [0:02:43]
 So let's set this back to 100 mm. [0:02:47]
 I'm going to place in geometry in here. [0:02:50]
 Let's say we add a box here. [0:02:53]
 And let's say we've built in some kind of containing box. [0:02:58]
 Now we're going to put some items in here for a client. [0:03:01]
 The client has given us some instructions. [0:03:04]
 They want any internal features to be released. [0:03:09]
 10 mm is away from the sides of the box. [0:03:14]
 Let's do this one as well. [0:03:17]
 So 10 mm is for this one. [0:03:21]
 And we'll set a length in here. [0:03:24]
 About 75 mm. [0:03:28]
 And this one a length of 25 mm. [0:03:37]
 So we've got the box, the client also wants a circle that's in here. [0:03:46]
 And the circle has a diameter of 50 mm. [0:03:55]
 Now the length here they want. [0:03:57]
 So I'm going to take this circle and this edge [0:04:01]
 and use a distance in here. [0:04:03]
 Now this is only in 0.21. [0:04:06]
 And we'll say that distance is 12 mm. [0:04:09]
 If you're doing this in earlier versions of 0.21 or 0.20, [0:04:15]
 then that's to lead to that. [0:04:17]
 You're going to have to add a point constraint [0:04:20]
 onto this circle. [0:04:22]
 The point on object constraint there. [0:04:25]
 It's going to get the mouse point back and use this point and this point and keep them in line. [0:04:31]
 Then we can create a constraint between this point and this point [0:04:36]
 sets in distance away of 12 mm. [0:04:40]
 But we have an issue in that the distance from here to here is smaller. [0:04:47]
 So that's add that in. [0:04:49]
 I'm just going to use the point constraint on here. [0:04:51]
 Point you can see we've got the object [0:04:55]
 constraints the point on object constraint as [0:04:57]
 kicked in and we see that because we've got the [0:05:01]
 Alt constraint on also have got the [0:05:04]
 Alt to remove redundant constraints. [0:05:07]
 So this is important because this will kick in in the moment [0:05:11]
 and we'll add the point to there. [0:05:15]
 Here's a gate to get the mouse point back or right mouse button. [0:05:19]
 So that the point and this center point of the circle and place those in line with horizontal constraint. [0:05:25]
 Now it's fully constrained but I can take these two points [0:05:30]
 and add that reference constraint in with the horizontal [0:05:33]
 you see it's become redundant constraint. [0:05:36]
 So if I okay that now we'll happen this will remove redundant constraints will kick in. [0:05:42]
 But I don't want that too so I'm going to take this point and this point [0:05:46]
 and set this length and set this to reference. [0:05:50]
 If I hit OK now I get a reference of how far away this is [0:05:57]
 and I can go back to the client and say well if you wanted this circle as a 50 mm [0:06:03]
 meter constraint a 50 mm diameter then something has to change somewhere [0:06:10]
 in this project to allow this to be that length. [0:06:14]
 For instance I could make this 12 mm length here [0:06:19]
 into a reference and hit OK we've now got this constraint [0:06:27]
 not restricting anything just adding as a reference [0:06:31]
 and I can go back to my other reference constraint here and set that [0:06:37]
 to 10 mm. [0:06:39]
 Allow me to say to the client well we've got a 5 mm gap in here. [0:06:46]
 Is that enough? [0:06:47]
 Or do we have to come in and change the length for this side? [0:06:53]
 Going into the 100 mm set that's a reference. [0:06:56]
 OK well we need the 10 mm gap at least here or say 12 mm [0:07:07]
 then as you can see everything's changed 7 mm of added to this length here [0:07:13]
 and we all good go back to the client just increase it by 7 mm is that OK. [0:07:20]
 You notice on the left hand side that the constraint is turned to blue to show its reference [0:07:26]
 constraint here and we can filter these if we wanted to we can come in [0:07:31]
 and look for the difference of the constraints in here so we got that and constraints [0:07:36]
 we got the name constraint we got reference constraints we got the selected constraint in there. [0:07:43]
 So some other examples of where to use reference constraints let's say we had a [0:07:49]
 gain of square or rectangle in here and we wanted to center [0:07:55]
 a whole let's say about here but the whole has to be a certain diameter [0:08:05]
 and has to change position when this is resize so it has to keep a constant space between these edges [0:08:14]
 they're going to hit the right mouse button to get the mouse point back and I'm going to [0:08:18]
 add some construction geometry so we're going to take a circle make a quince and a center of that [0:08:23]
 circle come out and we're going to touch this side with a tangent constraint get the mouse point [0:08:31]
 it back with the right mouse button or escape and then take this circle and this side and make [0:08:36]
 the tangent and we can take this circle and change it to construction mode so this doesn't affect [0:08:44]
 the geometry where it's padded and you won't see it when we close so what's happened now is that [0:08:51]
 we've got this circle in here let's put some diameter across here and make this five millimeters [0:08:58]
 so if we change the size of this rectangle then we get a constant length away from the sides [0:09:09]
 as you can see and then we can set up some reference geometry between this point and this point [0:09:18]
 and we could use either a distance like so click reference and okay and then we can see that move [0:09:30]
 in and out there so we can actually read off this distance or that's click on that and hit delete [0:09:37]
 we can set some lengths in here so a length here so that's reference and we'll add a length [0:09:47]
 in here as well so we can see how constant they are and set that to reference [0:09:52]
 so as this moves we can see that our construction geometry is working for us [0:10:04]
 and that whole sits a constant length away from the edges [0:10:10]
 another place that you would use this if say you was using a formula that's to leave that [0:10:18]
 it's highlighted or one to leave that and we'll add let's say a line to line here [0:10:25]
 and a line going this way the length of this line [0:10:32]
 place a length in here of 50 millimeters now the length of this line I want it to be a fraction [0:10:44]
 of this side so that's coming here and set the name and we'll call this less side [0:10:52]
 now we've come to here and place a length in here I want this as a formula so I'm going to use [0:11:04]
 the formula button and I'm going to type in constraints there's a dot there and you see the [0:11:10]
 less I come up so this the left side here and then we're going to times it that's say by [0:11:16]
 0.75 and here okay so we've got that formula in there and here okay okay so we get this [0:11:27]
 constraining here and you can see it's saying 37.5 if I then add a length so in here like so [0:11:37]
 here scapegovers the mouse pointed back so that's connected there I can say that length [0:11:43]
 set a distance and you can see we've got redundant constraint and set that to a reference [0:11:50]
 and here okay so we've got a reference for this length now so if we change this 50 millimeters [0:11:59]
 to say 43 then you can see our formula kicks in and plus we get the reference for this side so we [0:12:10]
 know how long this side's going to be so I hope that's giving you an idea of how to use the [0:12:15]
 reference constraints and what they are but you find that useful and I hope to see you in the next video [0:12:21]
