===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD For Beginners - 47 - Re-orientate sketch onto another face - How to Create Gussets =====
 Hi everyone and welcome to the channel and today we're going to be looking at [0:00:03]
 gussets such as these and how to create them in free-cad. We're going to take two [0:00:09]
 approaches for this one, the simple approach and a more complex approach such [0:00:13]
 as this but very fast and we're going to use a single sketch and use a [0:00:19]
 jubico of it in this instance and learn how to reorientate the sketch onto [0:00:24]
 another face and that's via the sketch and if we look down here we've got the [0:00:30]
 reorientate sketch option here so we're going to learn how to use that so I hope [0:00:34]
 you enjoy these videos and that's how to look how we would do this. If you like [0:00:39]

 about page or in the descriptions of these videos. So to create a simple [0:01:11]
 gusset we would use something like the part design that's great a simple [0:01:15]
 part in here, create a new body, new sketch and that's go on the XZ plane [0:01:24]
 as my witch plane and I'm just going to create an L-shaped bracket using the [0:01:30]
 polyline. Come down to the top, into the center and we're just going to sketch [0:01:37]
 something very simple like this and we'll add some constraints to this [0:01:44]
 let's hit a skate and a skate game to get the mouse on it back and use a horizontal [0:01:49]
 constraint on that one. I'm going to take these two and use a quality and let's pull [0:01:59]
 this back up and take these two and make those equals well. That's set a length [0:02:07]
 in here, around about 3mm and set this length height of 50mm. So we've got this [0:02:22]
 L-shaped bracket in here. We'll become kind of a bracket. Let's close that and we're [0:02:30]
 going to pad this now using the pad and we're pad this around about 80mm. So we have [0:02:38]
 this L-shaped. Obviously when we look at this the strength if we're placing load on [0:02:43]
 here we need something in here to stop this from bending. There's a number of ways [0:02:48]
 doing this. One of the ways is by taking this face and creating a sketch and we [0:02:55]
 are going to put a bit of audience in geometry. That's pulling this point here, while [0:02:59]
 pulling that line it doesn't matter and we hit the right mouse button or a skate because [0:03:06]
 the mouse put it back and we're going to use the pulley line again. That's one here and we [0:03:11]
 will just sketch in a triangle shaping here. This skate, we've got a mouse bent [0:03:19]
 back and use these two, make them equal, and then we can set a length in here. [0:03:26]
 It's up to you how long you want this so I can go 15mm and we've got this shape in here. [0:03:32]
 Now what we need to do is position this into the center. [0:03:36]
 So this is a very simple asset that we use. We're creating more complex one in the moment. [0:03:41]
 We'll use the sketch orientation to take a copy of our sketch and we orientate it. [0:03:46]
 So I'm going to take this one now, this sketch here, and set the attachment because it's attached. [0:03:53]
 We see the attachment is first attached it to this face and we'll set the position and the set. [0:04:01]
 Now this is 80mm long so I'm going to go for 40mm, so it sits in the middle. [0:04:07]
 And we need to use a minus 40mm, bring that to the middle, like so. [0:04:12]
 And now what we do is take that sketch and we pad it. [0:04:17]
 Now I'm going to pad it by 3mm. [0:04:20]
 You notice this is padding from the middle outwards. [0:04:23]
 If I hit symmetrical to plane then that sits back in the middle. [0:04:28]
 So there's a simple asset that we can add. [0:04:31]
 Obviously we could use a linear pattern across here if we wanted a number of them. [0:04:35]
 To reinforce this, but there's also another way. [0:04:39]
 So I'll okay that we can see that gussing there. [0:04:42]
 That's to delete that pad and look at a different way where we're orientating the sketch. [0:04:47]
 I'm going to delete the sketch as well. [0:04:50]
 So I'm going to use a loft between these two faces. [0:04:55]
 So first of all I'm going to select this face and I'm going to make one sketch, [0:04:59]
 or any sketch on that face. [0:05:02]
 They can see that sitting on that face there. [0:05:05]
 And I'm not going to pull in any geometry. [0:05:07]
 I'm going to use this point in here to get strain in geometry on this face. [0:05:15]
 Because I don't want to constrain to any external geometry. [0:05:19]
 I'm just going to do it to this center point. [0:05:22]
 So that's use a slot in here. [0:05:25]
 So I'm going to use a slot. [0:05:28]
 And we'll set the slot. [0:05:31]
 And here we have a diameter of 3 mm. [0:05:35]
 And I set a height to 20 mm. [0:05:41]
 So we've got that there and that's locked this down to the center. [0:05:45]
 So I know that this is 80 mm long. [0:05:48]
 So I'm going to take this point. [0:05:52]
 And that's around here and we can get this point. [0:05:55]
 There it is there. [0:05:58]
 And use this point vertical distance 40 mm. [0:06:06]
 And we'll do the same with the height as well. [0:06:09]
 Let's just come up to sketch. [0:06:11]
 And if you've section tied that, it makes it easier. [0:06:15]
 And we can get to this point. [0:06:17]
 So we've got both those points selected. [0:06:19]
 And that's use a height in there of 20 mm. [0:06:23]
 Let's bring that down a bit actually. [0:06:25]
 Let's bring this down to 15. [0:06:27]
 So we've got this sketch in here. [0:06:29]
 I want to do is create the same sketch on the other side. [0:06:32]
 So let's close that. [0:06:34]
 So we've got that there. [0:06:36]
 Now for creating the same sketch, I'm going to duplicate the sketch. [0:06:40]
 Come up to edit and duplicate selected objects. [0:06:43]
 The sketch is selected. [0:06:44]
 And that's removed the pad. [0:06:46]
 So only the sketch is selected there. [0:06:49]
 So we've got the square selection in that sketch. [0:06:53]
 That's hit OK. [0:06:54]
 That's duplicate that sketch now. [0:06:57]
 Now I want to place it upon this face here. [0:07:02]
 Now I can't just come in here and use the support. [0:07:06]
 And click on that. [0:07:08]
 That's a quick map mode. [0:07:10]
 And let this face because it's not orientated in the correct plane. [0:07:15]
 So we need to re-orientate the sketch. [0:07:18]
 But click that sketch. [0:07:20]
 Come up to sketch. [0:07:22]
 And come down to re-orientate sketch. [0:07:26]
 Because this sketch is a duplicate of this one, [0:07:30]
 it will be still connected to this. [0:07:32]
 So sketch for a support face cannot be re-orientated. [0:07:35]
 Do you want to detach it from its support? [0:07:37]
 Click yes. [0:07:38]
 And now we set the plane that we want to pawn. [0:07:41]
 And I want it upon this plane here, which is the X Y plane, [0:07:47]
 which is already selected in here because it's a default selection at the top. [0:07:51]
 I see it OK. [0:07:53]
 Now if we look, it's put it in edit mode. [0:07:56]
 So it's placed there. [0:07:58]
 That's close that. [0:07:59]
 We see the sketch is over here. [0:08:02]
 Take the sketch. [0:08:04]
 Select the sketch. [0:08:05]
 Make sure it's selected. [0:08:06]
 And the map mode at the moment is flat face. [0:08:09]
 Let's select that. [0:08:10]
 And now it's saying selecting. [0:08:12]
 And we can select the reference. [0:08:14]
 This one. [0:08:15]
 As you can see, it's now over this side. [0:08:20]
 Now this is where we have to re-orientate this onto this face here. [0:08:26]
 We could come down and use the round X, round Y, and the Z, X direction, etc. [0:08:34]
 But if we just click on flip sides, then it will flip it the other way round. [0:08:40]
 So it's just mirrored it over to the other side. [0:08:43]
 So now we've got that connected to that face. [0:08:45]
 Let's come up and hit OK. [0:08:48]
 Now what we can do is take these two and just loft between these. [0:08:53]
 So I'm going to select sketch one. [0:08:56]
 So let's sketch two. [0:08:57]
 Control select both of those. [0:08:59]
 And then use the loft. [0:09:01]
 So if we loft it across those. [0:09:04]
 And we'll create it now if I hit OK. [0:09:07]
 We created a support that goes across here for our gusset. [0:09:11]
 A good thing about using an additive loft is that when we come in, [0:09:16]
 we can actually edit these. [0:09:18]
 So we could edit this sketch. [0:09:20]
 And as long as we got the same edges long there, the number of edges, [0:09:23]
 then it will be the same on this side. [0:09:27]
 So for instance, we could have a really interesting gusset in here. [0:09:33]
 And that's delete some of this. [0:09:35]
 Now delete this one as well, horizontal, and we could bring this out. [0:09:42]
 Roof the equals. [0:09:45]
 So we've got something like this and hit close. [0:09:50]
 So we've got something a bit more interesting and something that can be used in a different application. [0:09:57]
 We're going to top you and see the gusset in there. [0:10:01]
 So in this example, I have the sketch sitting here. [0:10:06]
 And I want to make a jib cut of this sketch. [0:10:08]
 Now if you notice the sketch, it's busted right up against this length here. [0:10:14]
 So that's come up to the sketch. [0:10:18]
 You section. So I can see that in there. [0:10:21]
 And we can see how that's just sitting on the top there. [0:10:24]
 And let's close that. [0:10:26]
 We've got this sketch here. [0:10:28]
 And I want to mirror this based the across here. [0:10:32]
 So first of all, take the sketch and make a jib cut. [0:10:34]
 Edit. [0:10:35]
 Come down to the jib-case-letter objects. [0:10:39]
 I'm click the pad so we just got the sketch. [0:10:41]
 Oh, and there's the sketch is slated in there and hit OK. [0:10:44]
 We've made a jib cut of that sketch. [0:10:46]
 And now we're going to place it on here at the moment. [0:10:49]
 Still in the same place. [0:10:50]
 It still taps the same face. [0:10:52]
 So go up to the sketch and reorientate the sketch. [0:10:55]
 I'm going to place it upon this plane here. [0:10:59]
 Detach it from the face. [0:11:01]
 I think yes. [0:11:03]
 And look at the plane. [0:11:04]
 So this is going to be the x, y plane. [0:11:06]
 So it's this plane here. [0:11:08]
 Match it up. [0:11:09]
 And if you're handling it right hand corner, x, y, which is this one. [0:11:13]
 OK, that's closed straight away because it's going to be sitting over here. [0:11:21]
 And now we need to place this upon this face. [0:11:24]
 And we need to attach that to that face. [0:11:26]
 So take that sketch. [0:11:28]
 Look at the map mode. [0:11:29]
 It's flat face at the moment. [0:11:30]
 Let's let that. [0:11:31]
 There's nothing in the attaches. [0:11:34]
 Not attached. [0:11:35]
 The selecting. [0:11:36]
 The same selecting here. [0:11:37]
 It says reference one. [0:11:38]
 Here's selecting. [0:11:39]
 Quick this face. [0:11:41]
 And it's right way here. [0:11:43]
 OK. [0:11:44]
 So at the moment, well, you can see it's over here. [0:11:47]
 So we need to flip the sides. [0:11:51]
 So let's click on that sketch again and look at the map mode. [0:11:56]
 If it's over here, then it's worth what we're still in here. [0:11:59]
 Really shouldn't have closed this. [0:12:01]
 It shows you where it's. [0:12:02]
 Hit the flip sides. [0:12:04]
 So this one's checked. [0:12:06]
 Then just uncheck it. [0:12:07]
 If it's not checked, then check it. [0:12:09]
 That's it in there. [0:12:10]
 That's it. [0:12:11]
 OK. [0:12:12]
 Now we should get a nice clean loft between these two. [0:12:17]
 Because basically it's mirrored across here. [0:12:20]
 Mirrored across this line. [0:12:22]
 Take the first sketch and the second sketch. [0:12:24]
 Controls that those two. [0:12:26]
 Got to part design. [0:12:28]
 Create an addif feature. [0:12:31]
 And use the addif loft. [0:12:34]
 Or use it from the toolbar here. [0:12:37]
 That's what's going to happen. [0:12:40]
 And that's here. [0:12:41]
 OK. [0:12:42]
 And now we've got our gusset in there. [0:12:46]
 So taking a duplicate with our sketch, we're on the way to that. [0:12:49]
 And now it's placed here upon this face here. [0:12:53]
 And we've just lofted between those. [0:12:55]
 So that's how to create gussets in free CAD and reorientate sketches. [0:12:59]
 So it's quite useful when we're in duplicate our geometry to use all that faces. [0:13:03]
