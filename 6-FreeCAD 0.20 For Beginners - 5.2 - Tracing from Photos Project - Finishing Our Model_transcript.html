===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 5.2 - Tracing from Photos Project - Finishing Our Model =====
 I have one welcome back to another part of the Learning FreeCAD for beginners, where we're [0:00:04]
 teaching the fundamentals of freecad with practical examples and by learning freecad workflows. [0:00:10]
 We're in the middle of a project where we're creating a simple part by tracing reference images [0:00:14]
 in the image workbench using the SketchUp to trace those images into a part design work flow. [0:00:21]
 We're carrying when we left off in the previous tutorial, but this time we're combining the multiple reference images [0:00:26]
 along with what we created with the pool of pattern, bringing those together to create the end result. [0:00:32]
 If you have any further previous tutorial, you'll need to follow that to create one of the features of this object. [0:00:38]
 So that's how we look at we finished this object, so we can move on to something a bit more interesting. [0:00:42]

 So in our previous video we created this polar pun and this object. [0:01:13]
 We're going to use this to complete the whole object now. [0:01:16]
 So I'm just going to save this off as a different file. [0:01:20]
 And I'm going to delete the polar pattern and delete the pad. [0:01:29]
 Inside we have the sketch. I'm going to make sure the body is active. [0:01:36]
 I'll go to that if body. Therefore anything we create will be placed inside this body. [0:01:42]
 Otherwise it will actually create a new body and place those in there. [0:01:45]
 That's get some images in to finish off this object. So we're going to start in the image workbench. [0:01:52]
 And I'm going to hide the top plane and hide the sketch. [0:01:58]
 We're loading the image now so I'm going to come in create an image plane coming to the images. [0:02:06]
 And select the base dot jpeg and open that up. [0:02:13]
 This is going to be sitting on the x-y plane so you'll notice that this top image [0:02:18]
 this one here is actually on the wrong plane. I want to sort that out in a minute because that sketch [0:02:25]
 is also on the wrong plane. Let's click on the top. Now looking at the image we've got a [0:02:30]
 scale here but it's own it can scale the base of this. It's not good to scale any of this feature [0:02:36]
 because it has depth and this is closer to the camera. So that's scale this image now. [0:02:41]
 It's going to ask us for a distance and also select the two points. So I'm going to come in [0:02:47]
 from zero click and up to 14 and type in 140 millimeters because this ruler is in centimeters. [0:02:59]
 Set the image plane and hit OK and we're going to rename this to base plane. [0:03:07]
 We now can take some measurements off of here so I'm going to use the measure tool and come in [0:03:14]
 and just measure across here and we can see that's 47 or let's say that's about 48 millimeters. [0:03:22]
 That's bringing the other image so I'm going to come around to this side and bring [0:03:27]
 the side image. Gain the image workbench and we need to create an image in 3D space and we're [0:03:35]
 going to go down to the side, jpeg and open that up along the XZ plane and hit OK. [0:03:43]
 That's place that in there. It is around the wrong way but we can still go out in a minute. [0:03:48]
 Now let's have a look at the scale. We've got this scale here but it's no good to us because [0:03:54]
 this is closest to the camera. So we can take a reference off of this one. What we've taken [0:04:01]
 the length here so we're going to use the 47.54 or 48 millimeters. We can see it is [0:04:07]
 from this point to here. We can't do it from here because [0:04:15]
 what this is closest to the camera so that would be no good. So let's come around [0:04:20]
 and we'll scale from this point to this point 48 millimeters. So using the scale [0:04:28]
 and we want 48 millimeters and we're just in here and all the way up to [0:04:39]
 our here. So that the image plane and hit OK. That is skilled. Now that's written name that image plane [0:04:48]
 to the side plane. That's place this. So if we look it's round the wrong way so we need to flip [0:04:58]
 this round so let the side plane right click transform. Make sure our rotational [0:05:04]
 increments is set to 15. Therefore when we flip this around it's in increments of 15 and we get [0:05:11]
 nice little line there. Once I've walked it black so we come around to the other side we can see the [0:05:17]
 image click on the navigation so we can get it just right and we can start moving this up. [0:05:26]
 Get a little bit of angle so we can see the image underneath. There we go and we move this across [0:05:32]
 and we'll move this up like so. And just move this across so we can see [0:05:45]
 that sitting across there. Do some more adjustments in that in the moment. So we got the two [0:05:54]
 images in there and that's hide that distance. Let's go back to the top and I'm going to start [0:06:04]
 sketching this. We're upside down so let's bring this around. There we go. Let's come over to the [0:06:11]
 part design and make sure this body is active so it's bold if not it's right click to the [0:06:18]
 left if body and that's active there. Click the body and then create a new sketch and we want [0:06:25]
 it on the same plane so the x, y, plane, the top. Click the x, y, plane and we can start sketching. [0:06:31]
 This isn't positioned correctly so I just can come over to the model click on the base plane [0:06:38]
 come down to placement and we'll change the angle and just strain that up. [0:06:43]
 And we'll go position x, y, etc. And we'll move it up along the y axis and we start to get the square [0:06:52]
 in here. So let's click on the square for our rectangle coming and we just want to sketch [0:06:59]
 along this line here and out to here. Now we've got that in there we can set the length. [0:07:11]
 So remember right there this one was 48 millimeters. Now we go that's in there and this height [0:07:21]
 and that's 52 and I'm going to say that's 51 because I'll pull that in there and we can position [0:07:29]
 that so that should be about right. Now I'll go take these two points make sure enough is [0:07:36]
 slet it take the two corner points and we're going to make a symmetry across this point. [0:07:41]
 So that allows us to use these lines in symmetry constraints and tool symmetry tools. [0:07:49]
 So click the symmetry constraint that's there image will be out so we need to click the base plane [0:07:56]
 and change the y and put the image back. I'm pressing the up and down arrow is by the way [0:08:04]
 to put these in position. I can type in here but we can use the notch with the up and down arrow keys [0:08:10]
 and I'm going to go 1.5 there we go that's in position. Now I'm going to use the circle [0:08:19]
 and sketch in both these circles just one side. This one going to do is set these two points make [0:08:30]
 sure they have a horizontal constraint so they stay in line. So if I move one the other one will [0:08:36]
 move and we're set the radius or the diameter of these. So this one's 5.5 and this one [0:08:47]
 is 4. So we've got those in there and what we can do is take both these click them both [0:08:56]
 and then the last thing we've selected which is this line. Remember we'll say about using symmetry [0:09:03]
 to our vantage, go to sketch, sketch tools and symmetry and that places them in the [0:09:11]
 correct position over this side. We can add these two points and put those in horizontal constraint [0:09:19]
 and we can add vertical constraints to these two here vertical constraint. So now we've got [0:09:28]
 those two fine as add the same with this one as well. A vertical constraint and that's take [0:09:38]
 these two points set a vertical height of p.5. As come over to task we can see we've got three degrees [0:09:49]
 of freedom. Let's take this point and this point and set a length. So eight point two let's just [0:09:59]
 set that to eight. Two degrees of freedom because we can move left and right here. So set this one [0:10:11]
 and this one 6.5. So we've got we've got up and down to do. So this one and this one [0:10:24]
 vertical length of 8.5 as well. So we've got all that constrained down. [0:10:35]
 Now we need to pad this. So we can't pad this at the moment. If it closed come out because we [0:10:44]
 don't know how much to pad this. So we're going to use the other sketch just to come around to the [0:10:50]
 other side and bring this in. We're going to do some measurements across here. So let's get our padding. [0:10:56]
 So we can see that what we need to move this across so I'm going to click on our side sketch [0:11:07]
 cycling. I click transform and zoom out and I just move this in line to there because we [0:11:18]
 measured from this sketch because it comes from here to here. So we have to be wary of the width [0:11:25]
 here as well. So now that's there let's take a measurement across here. Using the measure tool [0:11:33]
 and get this measurement in which is this one. 1.92 millimeters and we can take this measurement [0:11:41]
 as well. So the measure tool be wary if you click on the sketch and there because you'll get the [0:11:51]
 measurement going along the plane as the sketch the surface of the sketch which we don't want. [0:11:56]
 So that's got to lead that one. I'm redo that with the measure tool which is here. [0:12:04]
 Let's come in and let's measure that 3.5 millimeters. We also need a height of this. [0:12:16]
 So measure from this point all the way up to the top. Here. 45.846 and we'll take the length [0:12:30]
 off here as well. So we're going measure here to here and that gives us a length. [0:12:38]
 Now we can start padding. So let's come down to this sketch. This one here and we'll [0:12:46]
 pad that and we need to pad it by 3.5 millimeters. So 3.5 millimeters in the length of a [0:12:56]
 head. Enter. This is transparent at the moment so we've got the transparency set on that body. [0:13:02]
 Let's click that body and look at the view and what you'll see if I zero that transparency out [0:13:08]
 that's what you'll see. So that is what it should look like. [0:13:14]
 Making sure that we check back our image with the pad to make sure it's round the right way. [0:13:23]
 It's quite easy to get carried away and just sketch this side rather than sketch this side. [0:13:31]
 So in that case I'm going to come around to this side. We're going to harm it [0:13:37]
 the base plane but present a spacebar and we're going to add a sketch to here. [0:13:42]
 This one here and we'll add a sketch from here. So that's a touch that face now. [0:13:53]
 Let's sketch. And we need to create a sketch. Place the list length. [0:14:00]
 If we've got an A or a 4.6 millimeters. It's pulling us to geometry so using the external geometry [0:14:08]
 tool we're going to pull in this corner. Go to top there and this corner just hover it over the corner [0:14:15]
 and we'll get a dot there. So those points we can add a rectangle to. We've got the [0:14:21]
 auto constraints set so I can hover over that point and create the first rectangle like so. [0:14:30]
 We're going to go into redundant constraint in a minute because I want to connect these two [0:14:35]
 points together. These two here and use the Quintest constraint. You can see we've got redundant [0:14:44]
 which is 5 and that will be this horizontal constraint here. So just click it it will highlight [0:14:49]
 and green and hit the delete key. Now we need to set some height which will be this one here. [0:14:59]
 So 46mm. So that's a good distance of 46mm. Now here I'll create a sketch for a pad. [0:15:11]
 So that's close it. We can see it there. That's fine some of these distances so I don't need [0:15:19]
 the distance 3.5 because that was the pad distance. We know this is the pad distance for [0:15:26]
 this one which is created which two mil we know that and we don't need the 45mm that's [0:15:33]
 get rid of that. Let's click that sketch which is created this one and pad that by two [0:15:41]
 millimetres in the length and here okay. So we've got that there. That's hide side plane. [0:15:50]
 That's how little we've got. Now we need to attach that sketch we created [0:15:58]
 of that featured two here. How do we do that? Because at the moment if we come out to that [0:16:02]
 sketch which is in the body and click on it to show it it sits on the bottom. Well if we look on the [0:16:10]
 data tab and look at the map mode and the support we can see what's happened. The support is the [0:16:16]
 X Y plane which is the top plane. All we do is click on this field click on the button the end [0:16:23]
 and it's important to hit clear you'll see this X Y plane will be removed. So move the window [0:16:29]
 across and set the face for you wanted to be. Watch what happens the sketch is there. Okay and [0:16:38]
 the sketch moves but it's not centered currently or it is around that center there but we need to [0:16:48]
 move it up. Simple thing we still got the sketch selected. We look at the attachment we look [0:16:54]
 down the attachment is first. The placement was first and we would change that. Coming to the [0:16:58]
 attachment this position is an offset for where it's placed. So that's how we look and compare it to [0:17:09]
 our position here. So we can see it's set is running this way but watch what happens if we move [0:17:16]
 the z press it up. Keep it's not moving probably it's actually moving away and this is all to do [0:17:26]
 with local and global positioning. What we want to do is move the Y axis. So using the Y and [0:17:36]
 moving that up right near the top. And see that placed right near the top because this feature [0:17:45]
 sets right at the top. So point two. There we go. That's there now. Almost sitting on that line. [0:17:54]
 Now let's there we can actually pad that and that will pad correctly. We know the length of that pad [0:18:04]
 from here which is 25mm so 25.3Ni so it's just put 25 in there and here okay. So we've got that pad [0:18:17]
 and now we can create our pull-up and now we do before. Click the pad. Kind of the part design, [0:18:24]
 apply a pattern and click pull-up and start into a play around the center point. We can see [0:18:34]
 our axis is Nord Sketch and we need to change the occurrences to four. In the previous video you [0:18:42]
 actually saw these in red but because we've got them on a pad then they're actually part of that [0:18:47]
 object then not making a multiple body object. So that's good. I see it okay. [0:18:54]
 We've got that feature in there now. We've got one more feature to make so we're coming around to the [0:19:02]
 side of the plane. This one here. We can see this support. So now we need to add that in. [0:19:09]
 Let's have a look at the base plane as well. So we can see this base plane. That's transform that [0:19:19]
 right click transform and move that up so it sits on top and we can see that. [0:19:26]
 Let's pop through there so we get whereabouts those meant to be. So yeah okay. I'm going to hide [0:19:33]
 the distance because we don't need that anymore for a special distance. So let's click on the top [0:19:38]
 and move this down and figure out how we're going to actually create this. Now I'm going to tackle [0:19:46]
 this from the side so this side here. So let's click on the rear and click on this face and we're [0:19:54]
 going to create a sketch. The place is a sketch upon there but we're going to move it. [0:20:00]
 All right okay. I'm going to pull in these edges. So using the geometry [0:20:07]
 and pulling both of these edges. This gives me something to attach a sketch to and to make [0:20:15]
 sure that it's part of this body. So it doesn't create multiple bodies and courses in there. [0:20:21]
 Now we've got that in there. I can decide where I'm going to place this feature and those [0:20:27]
 can be along this edge we're going to move it in a moment. Let's come up to the arc, [0:20:32]
 endpoint and room point arc and I'm looking to see where it starts. It starts about here [0:20:39]
 and moving this all the way up to here and we're going to match that arc or near enough. That's [0:20:47]
 in there now. I'm going to hit a scale to get the mouse point back and I'm going to use the polyline [0:20:52]
 and it connects up to this point. Come down to this point and then come across to this point [0:21:00]
 with the order constraints and hit a scale to release the polyline and hit a scale to get the [0:21:07]
 mouse point back. We can adjust these by moving them out and matching that. That sets some constraints [0:21:16]
 so I'm going to set a height of 32 millimeters and a length of 40 millimeters. Also I'm going [0:21:26]
 to set a radius so this one here and set the radius. That's the radius. It's a diameter of one [0:21:35]
 and that can be 72.5 millimeters. We've got that at the moment it's still moves and that's because [0:21:45]
 this point is not quinstant to this point so that's set that. But over good strained [0:21:53]
 point six which is going to be that horizontal constraint there and hit delete. That's fully [0:22:00]
 constrained so let's hit close and see what's happened. We've got this sketch that's seen here. [0:22:08]
 I'm going to move this sketch to whereabouts this feature is so I'm going to click on the top [0:22:17]
 make sure that sketch has been selected and we're going to move it. Come down to the attachment [0:22:24]
 the placement is in first the attachments is first and we're going to move that. Now it should [0:22:33]
 be a long z-plane so we can see that's long z-plane because that's said plane is normal to that sketch. [0:22:43]
 So that means it runs away from the sketch. That's why so I'm going to move that so it's the [0:22:53]
 other side because our padding comes this way and we'll go this way we can reverse it if we want [0:22:59]
 I'm just going to move that into position. Now that's in position make sure the sketch is selected [0:23:06]
 and we'll pad if we didn't take a measurement across here so we can quickly measure that. [0:23:12]
 Stay in measurement 2.7 so it's about 3 millimeters and hit okay so we've sketched that feature [0:23:26]
 I can see it hasn't come out far enough so that's go back into that pad so let's come up [0:23:33]
 because a bit space coming to that pad and double click that sketch we need to add some angle [0:23:43]
 so we can see that in there and let's change this constraint and let's try 43 mil [0:23:54]
 that's more or less right I mean I can delete that and move this point until we get there [0:24:06]
 like so it's a bit hard to see with everything around there and well we need to come into the [0:24:18]
 and just come up to that polar ray and press the spacebar so we can see what's going on [0:24:23]
 and we go and now we can set some length in there at this point to this point or just set the length [0:24:34]
 for this so 43.8 so I say 44 and okay now we come down to that pad what we need to first [0:24:47]
 make sure we get the mouse point back so click right click there go [0:24:50]
 try that again okay press the spacebar and we can see that's in position now [0:25:00]
 we're almost there but we can see that's what that's mirrored over here so we need to make a [0:25:12]
 copy of this over here so what do we need to do it's coming we'll use a mirror so we'll click on that pad [0:25:21]
 this one here just collapse the sketch and that's come over to the part design [0:25:28]
 we've still got the sketch open if you see all of these here that means we still got this sketch open [0:25:38]
 so we just hit close and now we've got all of the toolbars back that means I moved from [0:25:44]
 the sketch or workbench to the part design workbench without closing the sketcher [0:25:48]
 then let's click top and click on that pad so this one here click on the pad [0:25:56]
 we're going to mirror this now so go out to part design [0:26:00]
 play a pun and mirror it so now we've got the mirror what we need to select the right axis [0:26:07]
 so looking down we need to mirror this over the xz axis so we need to flip it over the axis [0:26:17]
 at the moment you can see it's flipped over the vertical sketch axis let's drop this down to the [0:26:24]
 xz axis we're going to accept plane and what last mirrored perfectly we can look our way through these [0:26:33]
 if we got problems trying to figure out what axis is to all planes to use so the xz plane there [0:26:41]
 so that's mirrored across there and we'll hit okay that's height this plane now this [0:26:51]
 side image reference for present spacebar and let's have a little bit more we got so we got [0:26:59]
 the base plane image and we click on that so we can click on a here or click on the [0:27:06]
 image yourself for present spacebar we're almost done but we need some fillet in around here [0:27:15]
 some chamfering and I believe we need the same here as well so that's do this one first [0:27:23]
 so I think I'm going to do this chamfering first so let's get a measurement of the chamfer we need [0:27:30]
 he's in the measure tool once again and we look at the top and measure [0:27:38]
 across here we've got 2.75 millimeters that's hide that base plane and we can see that we've [0:27:49]
 got that measurement there so we can use that as a reference let's click on that circular edge [0:27:56]
 and come up to the chamfer tool this one here it's in a part design [0:28:04]
 apply a dress up feature chamfer and changes to 2 mil and this one's 2.75 so that's [0:28:17]
 changed to 2.75 it's gone right out there and okay that seems okay that and we'll go for that [0:28:30]
 that's had enough edge and I add this edge as well see that it's showing it's not really showing [0:28:39]
 there so we can tweak that up to 3.75 and bring that back down and that's been applied so 2.75 [0:28:47]
 that's the chamfer added now that's do these edges here as well so that's take a look at the [0:28:58]
 base plane image going so we've got this here I'm going to right click on that and transform this [0:29:06]
 and bring it down I may even turn the body transparency I can see underneath [0:29:13]
 the fact that's do that as well come on to the body got to the view and look at the transparency [0:29:21]
 and bring that transparency up to about 50 now we go so we can see through that [0:29:26]
 so our base plane image move that down a bit so we can see those edges [0:29:37]
 okay that and that's set these edges so it's like that edge that's control click the [0:29:47]
 average as well and use the fillet which is under the dress up as well you can see both those edges [0:29:54]
 have been added and we can start showing for in this so let's bring these around so we can see as we [0:30:02]
 bring them around you see how they're intersecting the image underneath when they get to the right [0:30:09]
 radius which is about 6 millimeters okay that now the one we want to do now is this side [0:30:18]
 so let's come up and look at the top plane this one here which is no longer the top plane [0:30:27]
 because it's sitting on the bottom if we roll over it you can see where while you can see it appear [0:30:33]
 so right click transform and we need to flip this this way I believe actually we need to flip it around [0:30:43]
 the other way as well my clapped scarrows has you right and there we go and we'll move that up [0:30:55]
 and forward and we do the same well intersect that pad bring it down [0:31:06]
 and bring this around this have a look and must remember that only the front of this is in [0:31:17]
 perspective so we're going to line it up with our feature here and we can re-scal this actually that's [0:31:26]
 we scroll this let's hit okay so we know what's our length so let's come down to our first pad [0:31:34]
 look at that sketch come down to the data come down to our constraints and we've got we can [0:31:44]
 strengthen here we've got 48 51 double click that sketch so we've got the 48 and the 51 [0:31:53]
 so we need the 51 let's close that and hide that body a second click on the body press space [0:32:04]
 and we'll re-scal this top image plane in the image so it's going along here so let's click the [0:32:17]
 scale scarrows plane 51 millimeters and click this point and this point and click the top [0:32:29]
 plane and here okay I see what's happened let's bring that body back that's better and we're just [0:32:39]
 transform that into position almost finished okay a little bit of angle on that [0:32:51]
 I've got that was quite thin so we can see that it's come back to the part design and that's [0:33:02]
 get that age so we want this edge and zoom out find the average control click the average [0:33:12]
 it's not like the sketch I wear it just you can click and then unclick to select you have to [0:33:18]
 control click those edges and then we're going to use the tool to fill it or I'll design apply [0:33:25]
 dress up and then come into fill it we fill it in those now we can see the image underneath [0:33:36]
 we're just increased that fill it up let's use the up hierarchy [0:33:40]
 can be up on and that is about right so we've got a 19 millimeter fillet going all the way around there [0:33:52]
 that's one small and I think 20 millimeters is going to be okay I can go for 20 [0:34:05]
 and here okay so to the model look down the silver guinea errors no we haven't we can [0:34:13]
 hide these distances for present spacebar on those hide the base plane hide the top plane [0:34:21]
 and we have our model finished [0:34:26]
 it's going to the body and change the transparency so look at the view [0:34:35]
 look at the transparency and just set that to zero to bring that in and we've got our finished model [0:34:42]
 so in next video we're going to be looking at SVGs how to be important [0:34:49]
 into free CAD and how to start using the part workbench to manipulate those into free deal [0:34:55]
