===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 6 - Using SVG in the Part Workbench =====
 Hi everyone, I'm Ok to another episode of the Learning FreeCAD for beginners. [0:00:04]
 Where we teach the fundamentals of freecad, using practical examples, along as we teach [0:00:09]
 freecad workflows. [0:00:11]
 In the previous episode we looked at creating a 3D object from a number of reference images [0:00:17]
 using those to trace and create the object in 3D space. [0:00:21]
 In this video we're looking at important SVGs, even once we created an in-scape, or once [0:00:26]
 we've actually imported from external sources. [0:00:29]
 We're going to be using those in a part workflow. [0:00:34]
 So this is a bit different from part design. [0:00:36]
 The part workbench uses Boolean functions and it's basically the Swiss Army Knife of [0:00:41]
 FreeCAD. [0:00:43]
 Our end result is taking an SVG from a laser cut project using the Struude and Boolean [0:00:48]
 operations to turn that 2D object into a 3D one. [0:00:52]
 That we can later use in CNC or 3D printer rather than going down the laser cut or [0:00:58]
 cut cut route. [0:01:00]
 I've also included a couple of sources that we can use to create these models. [0:01:05]
 This include freeaccess.co, which is a laser cut site where I've got this original model [0:01:10]
 from, and picks a bay.com that has both vector and raster-based images that we can use [0:01:17]
 in freecad. [0:01:18]
 So I hope you enjoy these videos and that's how we look at the subject area. [0:01:22]

 So for this tutorial we're going to start off in Inkscape. [0:01:49]
 Inkscape is a free external vector graphic editor that allows you to edit such files as [0:01:56]
 SVGs, DFX, the old CAD format, etc. [0:02:01]
 It's totally free. [0:02:02]
 It's basically the same as Adobe Illustrator but it's open source. [0:02:05]
 I'm going to create some objects in here so I'm going to start, say it was circle and [0:02:12]
 a square. [0:02:14]
 And we're going to place a path in here as well. [0:02:17]
 This is just for demonstration purposes. [0:02:19]
 I'm going to show you what happens when we have SVG and actually important in. [0:02:26]
 Now, one thing to remember is that this document, the coordinates of X0, Y0 start at this [0:02:33]
 point here. [0:02:35]
 So when we right click and transform these parts because these individual parts will [0:02:41]
 be paths inside free CAD. [0:02:43]
 So handlers to transform will be at this point here. [0:02:47]
 So I'm just going to add a small square, say here. [0:02:53]
 And we'll see that is at that point. [0:02:56]
 Let's see what I think to remember if I come up to the objects and we'll bring this down [0:03:04]
 before we go to the open. [0:03:05]
 You can see we've got rectangle 16, path 14, etc. [0:03:08]
 Coming down here. [0:03:10]
 These will appear with the same name in free CAD when we import the SVG file into free CAD. [0:03:17]
 Let's see this quickly. [0:03:19]
 So file, say this. [0:03:20]
 And we'll look down here. [0:03:21]
 We've got plain SVG. [0:03:22]
 We've got a number of other formats down here. [0:03:26]
 And you'll notice that we have some formats, such as this one. [0:03:30]
 That free CAD supports. [0:03:33]
 I'll keep with the default and hit save. [0:03:36]
 First, test.svg. [0:03:39]
 So right back and replace it. [0:03:41]
 So we've got our basic SVG. [0:03:44]
 If we come out of in-scape and come into free CAD on the create new document, I'm going [0:03:50]
 to go to file and import. [0:03:53]
 All we have to do is select our SVG file and open it. [0:03:58]
 It lasts a span of DPI settings. [0:04:00]
 We'll just hit yes and take the defaults. [0:04:03]
 You can see each of those parts has been imported and you can see the name in is the same [0:04:08]
 as in the in-scape. [0:04:10]
 If we roll over each of these, you can see that they appear in yellow shown which ones [0:04:15]
 they are. [0:04:16]
 I'm going to come over to something called part workbench to manipulate this. [0:04:21]
 Now the part workbench and the part design have similarities and some people don't know [0:04:26]
 which one to use over the other. [0:04:28]
 If you think about the part workbench as a Swiss Army knife or free CAD, you can have [0:04:33]
 many tools in there to use with other workbenches or we use it as itself. [0:04:38]
 Then you'll see that the part design is a very restrictive workflow that is dedicated [0:04:43]
 to building a part in a traditional CAD process. [0:04:48]
 They have interchangeable uses but the part workbench has more functions across free CAD [0:04:54]
 in total compared to the part design. [0:04:57]
 So the way they pad and pocket is different. [0:05:01]
 For instance in the part workbench I can pad these as known as a student part. [0:05:07]
 So if I take any of these, these will have a normal access that runs away from them or [0:05:15]
 even downwards depending on the path or the object that's been imported via SVG. [0:05:22]
 They differ from each of these objects. [0:05:24]
 Some of them won't have an all plane. [0:05:28]
 So for instance these rectangles, you would have thought that all plane would be running [0:05:33]
 this way so when we pad this or it's screwed it, then it will just run this way and [0:05:40]
 not any problems all run downwards. [0:05:42]
 That's not the case. [0:05:43]
 That's take this path first. [0:05:46]
 So this one here. [0:05:47]
 I only got to click an edge for the path to be selected on the left hand side. [0:05:54]
 And we'll use the Struit which is the same as a pad or part Struit and we're going to [0:06:00]
 Struit it along the normal. [0:06:02]
 So that's normal to plane. [0:06:05]
 So that'll Struit it normal to that plane of the input shape. [0:06:09]
 So I'm going to set this to a length of say 6mm. [0:06:14]
 Well that's actually let's go about 50mm. [0:06:18]
 I've got some options in here. [0:06:20]
 We can tape it. [0:06:21]
 Great solid. [0:06:22]
 And I'm going to go create solid and select it. [0:06:24]
 And when we hit OK or happen is that you can see that's gone downwards. [0:06:30]
 The default was downwards. [0:06:33]
 We can change that by just clicking on the Struit and coming in on the data tab and looking [0:06:39]
 at the length forward and we could go minus 50. [0:06:43]
 And then we'll Struit it upwards or if we leave it 50, we can select the direction mode. [0:06:52]
 And the moment it's normal we can set it to custom. [0:06:57]
 And then we can change the direction above. [0:07:00]
 Drop this down. [0:07:01]
 We've got Z minus one. [0:07:04]
 And we just change it to one instead. [0:07:06]
 That sends it upwards. [0:07:09]
 Let's try these ones. [0:07:10]
 This one here. [0:07:12]
 Let's screw that. [0:07:13]
 This time used the toolbar. [0:07:16]
 And we can tape the default so we can see that is one there. [0:07:19]
 And hit OK. [0:07:21]
 It's same it can't determine the null factor for the shape so we can't. [0:07:24]
 The Struit. [0:07:25]
 So we're going to have to use a custom method. [0:07:28]
 So we can use this custom direction and this egg axis is one there. [0:07:32]
 We can click on this and it changes to minus one. [0:07:35]
 And we've got the option to actually send it in different directions as well. [0:07:38]
 So we can send it along the X or the Y, etc. [0:07:43]
 That's it OK. [0:07:45]
 And that's the Struit that one. [0:07:47]
 Now remember what I was talking about when we come to transform this. [0:07:52]
 So if I transform this one, our handle will be over here. [0:07:56]
 So I right click transform. [0:07:58]
 You can see it's over here. [0:08:01]
 And that's because this one wasn't created around the top of the document. [0:08:08]
 So our document, if we think about back in Inkscape, our document basically came around here. [0:08:14]
 And this object here, this rectangle was created at that point. [0:08:20]
 So we can see that by going right click transform. [0:08:23]
 And it's there. [0:08:25]
 Now if it's true to these, we can use any of these options here. [0:08:30]
 So the part workbench allows for Boolean operations. [0:08:35]
 We don't use paths, we don't use pockets. [0:08:39]
 We use an astute. [0:08:41]
 And if I wanted to say pocket this shape into here, let's give it some astusion. [0:08:49]
 About 50 millimeters on the Z. [0:08:53]
 And here, OK. [0:08:55]
 We'll first all have to transform my new astusion into place. [0:09:05]
 So and then I would use a Boolean operation against there. [0:09:12]
 Now that's requires two selections. [0:09:16]
 We've got the Boolean operations on the toolbar. [0:09:18]
 We've also available on the part, drop down under Boolean. [0:09:23]
 And we've got a number of operations here. [0:09:25]
 So I'm going to use a cut operation to start with. [0:09:28]
 So I'm going to select the astute. [0:09:30]
 So you can see it's selected in the left hand side here. [0:09:33]
 Just click on the faces that selects this strewd. [0:09:36]
 I'm going to hold down control and select the object that I want to remove from the [0:09:42]
 one. [0:09:43]
 I'll just click to first you click the one you want to keep and the one you want to remove [0:09:47]
 full the cut. [0:09:48]
 Cut to part, come down to the Boolean operations and go over to cut. [0:09:55]
 That cuts that object from there. [0:09:57]
 And we can see how that's being removed inside. [0:10:00]
 What's happened on the tree view is you have a cut here. [0:10:05]
 And this differs from part design because we have a nested operations within rather than [0:10:12]
 a linear operations where you have the tip, the last operation. [0:10:18]
 We're not dealing with bodies. [0:10:19]
 We've got multiple bodies in here. [0:10:20]
 So each of these individual parts can be a body. [0:10:25]
 And we can export out each of these individual parts as well as by clicking on one. [0:10:30]
 And going to file and export. [0:10:34]
 Now I export out this part here. [0:10:37]
 Boolean is the same but we just joined two parts together so for instance I can take this [0:10:43]
 strewd and transform it into place. [0:10:50]
 So it intersects our object and here okay. [0:10:55]
 And we can just select both those objects. [0:10:57]
 I hold it down the control and using the Boolean operation or the Union operation. [0:11:05]
 The Boolean operation gives us a number of options there and we can choose which one we want. [0:11:11]
 The Union operation just joins us together in a fusion. [0:11:17]
 So you can see we've taken the original cut and this rectangle underneath and Union those [0:11:25]
 together. [0:11:27]
 And we can see those in there. [0:11:29]
 So now we've got the base. [0:11:30]
 It's down. [0:11:31]
 That's the look out bringing an external file from a third party. [0:11:35]
 So it's closed all. [0:11:39]
 And I'm going to create an end document. [0:11:41]
 That's the input the file for file, input. [0:11:46]
 And this one originally came from a laser cut site and we're just input in there. [0:11:53]
 So what I want to do is basically give these depth so I can free-deprint it rather than [0:11:58]
 later cut it or we can put it on the CNC machine. [0:12:03]
 Best to work from the top and zoom in and we can see we've got a number of objects in here. [0:12:08]
 So if I click this one so I'm just clicking an edge and you can see past six is highlighted [0:12:13]
 there. [0:12:14]
 And if I roll over it you can see the whole object is highlighted. [0:12:18]
 All of that one we can just hit this root and decide how deep we want this so let's [0:12:24]
 go for about three millimeters and here okay and we've just extruded that. [0:12:31]
 For something like this one, this one here for click on that, this path too. [0:12:37]
 If we're screwed that well we need to take out these objects inside. [0:12:43]
 Now if we click on these objects we can see each one of these is an individual object. [0:12:49]
 Remembering back to our Inkscape file, we are created a number of objects on that document. [0:12:56]
 This is the same. [0:12:57]
 These are just all squares and they represent the holes in this object. [0:13:02]
 So that's first to extrude this object and we're going to go five millimeters, [0:13:08]
 actually three millimeters and here okay. [0:13:11]
 Now the problem we got is that we need to do the same with these and basically cut it away [0:13:17]
 from this object because those are basically just sitting on top of that and we need to remove [0:13:22]
 them away from here. [0:13:23]
 So I'm going to click on the extrude and press the space bar that hides it inside [0:13:27]
 this extrude you'll see that we've got the path in there and it's been hidden. [0:13:32]
 Ultimately once this extrude has been created. [0:13:36]
 What I need to do is place the take these and distract them from that extrude. [0:13:43]
 Now we don't need to do the one by one we can group these together because first thing [0:13:49]
 I need to do is make an extruder for these so I'm going to come up to edit and box selection [0:13:54]
 and I need to select all of these so I'm going to come in and put a box selection around those [0:14:03]
 and hold down the control key and kind of to the edit box selection again and we're [0:14:11]
 box-select around here and we're doing some more. [0:14:15]
 So I've got the control key held down and we can even just select these edges and these will [0:14:26]
 select the path if you look to the left hand side you can see the paths are being added to my [0:14:31]
 selection as I click them. Although they're from being fully highlighted they've been added [0:14:38]
 selection. Again the part what bench comes in handy here because we can join these all together [0:14:43]
 in some it called a compound. So part come down to the compound and make a compound object. [0:14:50]
 If we look down we can see the compound has been created here and it contains inside all [0:14:58]
 those objects so all those parts are in there. We're compounds what we can do here is a [0:15:06]
 extruder as well so we can click on the extrude free millimeters again and hit OK so that's been [0:15:15]
 a extruder by free millimeters that's bring back our our extruder is there well we've got a bit [0:15:22]
 of a problem because this is not embedded into here so if we wanted to remove this from this object [0:15:29]
 it's just sitting on top so it won't make a cut between these all we need to do is [0:15:37]
 well we take one of them let's take this one right click transform [0:15:42]
 and we'll move this up or move it down into position. Now the idea is to get the top and the [0:15:52]
 bottoms protruding from the object it can be a bit tricky so one might have doing it just OK that [0:16:00]
 and we'll click on the astute of the compound so that's true there and it comes down and [0:16:10]
 change the length to something like that's changed it to 10 so that's what I salt it this way [0:16:20]
 I saw it by pushing it down so I can set the symmetry to true and click off and those have gone [0:16:29]
 all the way through there I can now click on the one that want to keep which is disistute and then [0:16:37]
 control click the one that want to remove now all I have to do is control click one of these and [0:16:42]
 you see the other is screwed it's been selected the compound is true and we'll use the cut [0:16:48]
 and that's removed that compound from our astute it's as simple as that and it's the same case [0:16:59]
 for something like this more complex to show you here so you can see we've got a number of [0:17:05]
 different paths that I've seen basically on top of each other this way you get all this flashing [0:17:11]
 and we can join these up so I'm going to hold down the control key and join these two up [0:17:17]
 and create a compound of those we've got compound tools here so you can see this drop down [0:17:23]
 we can create a compound there so that's create a compound I want there I can press this [0:17:29]
 space bar to hide that and well I can see inside here now so I've got these I can select [0:17:39]
 and we're coming the controls that those and we'll do the same here [0:17:47]
 and we'll even take this one as well and we'll create compound but this time we go to the drop down [0:17:58]
 so I may compound so now we've got that one and we've got the others inside so [0:18:06]
 we'll we have to do now is basically take those two compounds and we can even mark this [0:18:15]
 like this so I've hold down the controls that to both those compound and I'm going to [0:18:19]
 extrude those and we'll set the z axis to one and we're screwed those by five millimeters as [0:18:28]
 well okay we get two astrusions so you can see those there this one and this one [0:18:36]
 now click the one that want to keep control click from the tree view or the screen if I can [0:18:49]
 actually get them here's the tree view while I want to remove and use the cut and you can see how [0:18:58]
 those have been removed from inside there we'll be creating outliers such as this to create [0:19:05]
 astrudes, pad and pockets these outlines take the shape that you want to create and look [0:19:11]
 it from say the top or the side to create the end result these outlines are known as profiles [0:19:18]
 so profiles in outline of something as seen from one side astrudes pads and pockets allow [0:19:24]
 to profile to be extruded in a set direction but we're not limited to astrudes for example [0:19:30]
 in a part design workflow we have a number of additive operations that allows to use a profile in [0:19:37]
 a different way whether that be revolving the profile around a set degree, locked in the profile [0:19:44]
 along other profiles allowing it to morph into shape or using something called a pipe also known as [0:19:50]
 a sweep where we create material along a path used in our profile or multiple profiles the part [0:19:56]
 design workbench also offers a subtractive operation where we have our object but we remove material [0:20:03]
 from in those processes we've also got the same features in a part workflow but these are more [0:20:11]
 flexible in which profiles you can use in our next couple of videos would be explaining in [0:20:15]
 these workflows to answer such questions as where you choose say a revolve in the part design [0:20:22]
 over a revolve in the part so hope you enjoy this series and I hope to see you in the next video [0:20:28]
