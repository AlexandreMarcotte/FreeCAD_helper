===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 7 - Revolve and Sweep for More Complex Modelling - Part Design =====
 Hi everyone and welcome to another episode of the Learning Free Cat for Beginners, [0:00:04]
 we'll be teaching the fundamentals of free cat with practical examples and learning this [0:00:09]
 through workflows. We're on tutorial 7 and we're going to progress from our standard sketches [0:00:14]
 where we're creating pads and pockets and instead we're going to be looking at profiles. [0:00:19]
 We're going to be learning how to use profiles in a part design workflow where we're using additive [0:00:25]
 features and later we're going to be using the subtractive features which are the groove, [0:00:30]
 the subtractive loft and the subtractive pipe. Though we've got these tools in the part design [0:00:36]
 workflow we also have the same tools in the part but the part workflow also offers much more [0:00:43]
 flexibility when we create our models and we're going to be going through that in a number of [0:00:48]
 other videos. At the end of this video you'll be able to create this model. Now this is a control [0:00:54]
 knob for a cooker or some other electrical equipment and we've made this from a revolve and a sweep. [0:01:01]
 We're going to be taking you through this model showing you how to first create it from standard [0:01:05]
 the screws and pockets and then we're going to show you how wide we are to understand how to use [0:01:10]
 revolves and sweeps and show you how much easier it is. So I hope you enjoy this journey and let's [0:01:15]
 have a look at this technique. If you like we've seen please subscribe to the site. I also have a [0:01:21]
 co-fire or a coffee site that you can donate to if you so desire and that's at kho-hifinf i.com [0:01:28]

 span the channel. So if you've been following these tutorials you understand the basic concepts [0:01:46]
 of a pad and pocket and also the basic concepts of the astroode in the part workbench. We're in the [0:01:52]
 part design we're looking at a sketch at the moment. Now from this sketch we create a pad. [0:01:57]
 If we look at the pad what we've done it's just taken the top profile of an object and [0:02:04]
 astroode it that along a single vector. Now pattern pockets also astroode depending on what workbench [0:02:10]
 you're using are quite limited in direction that we want to go. We can only go in one direction [0:02:16]
 we can't curve that object or use multiple profiles in our astroode. For that we have to use a [0:02:24]
 different technique. Now if we look across here you can see a number of different icons we've got the [0:02:30]
 yellow ones that are additive and the red and blue ones that are subtractive in here you'll see [0:02:38]
 the pad but also we got the revolve the additive loft and the sweep or the additive [0:02:46]
 and we've got the subtractive versions of those as well. Over in the part workbench we have the same [0:02:54]
 but they're just called loft, sweep and revolve. We don't have subtractive versions of those [0:03:01]
 those are done with Boolean operations. These tools or these operations allow you to create [0:03:07]
 objects from profiles in different ways. So for instance we can revolve a profile around an axis [0:03:14]
 around a reference to create circular objects. We can loft profiles through other profiles such as [0:03:22]
 when you're creating an error foil or even a vase we've also got the sweep that allows us to sweep [0:03:29]
 profile along a path and also for either profiles along that path. Now the difference between these [0:03:35]
 operations in the part and part design are that in the part design we need a close sketch. In the [0:03:42]
 part it's much more forgiving and it allows us to use a close sketch and open sketch and edge [0:03:48]
 even a factor. So what I like to do now is take something like a cook or control knob and show [0:03:55]
 you how to create that in the part design. So in the part design I've started a new document and I'm [0:04:02]
 going to create a body and I'm going to create a sketch. Going along the xy plane and we're going to [0:04:07]
 just sketch the cook and I'll be in here from looking down which is going to use a screws and [0:04:14]
 pockets first and then move on to something like a revolve to show you how quicker it is to create [0:04:21]
 the object. And start with a circle in here and I'm not going to do too much constraining so I can [0:04:30]
 move through it as quickly. I need to start off with some diameter of around 50mm and we'll close that [0:04:37]
 and we'll click the sketch. It's already selected there. That's see if we can get it on screen first [0:04:42]
 so we know where about this. There we are. We're screwed that around about 25mm. That's [0:04:50]
 absent taper as well so that's add around about or going to go minus to taper the top like so [0:05:00]
 and it's the 35. That's 25mm. Now go and okay that. So we've got our base shape we need to [0:05:10]
 hollow out the bottom. So we're going to click on face create a sketch in there. Remember in this [0:05:17]
 is only for pockets and pants at the moment so we can look at this and see how much easier is to [0:05:25]
 create this with a revolve. So I've got the circle in here. I'm just going to hit a skate [0:05:31]
 get a mouse point about and bring this out like so that's hit close. Now I'm going to pop it this [0:05:37]
 and we need to match the taper which I've forgotten what it is so that's bring the taper down [0:05:45]
 like so and increase the length inwards. I can't remember what the taper was before but [0:05:54]
 we need to really match the taper on the outside and the inside. Otherwise we're going to get into [0:05:58]
 problems if we pocket too far and we get fin enough material. We're just working out speed and I'm [0:06:04]
 going to okay that. I'm now going to add the shaft that sits in here so click on that face and you can [0:06:12]
 see how many actions we've already done. We've done two already this is our third and we'll add a [0:06:19]
 circle. It comes out to here and it's close that and we'll pad that forwards and I want to come [0:06:30]
 right out so it access it at the top and we'll add some taper on there as well so we'll bring this down [0:06:37]
 to something like minus minus 18 a little bit further. Okay that and then we add basically the connection [0:06:47]
 part here so here we're going to look for the there a d pocket but we're just going for a single hole [0:06:58]
 in there like so close that and that's pocket that and we'll pocket that to a death of say 20mm [0:07:06]
 so it's gone through there it hasn't come out of the top so that's about right so that's your basic [0:07:13]
 shape for control knob. We need to add some other features on here but we get to that in a moment. [0:07:19]
 So we've done four portions so we've got the pad pocket, pad and then pocket again. We could do [0:07:27]
 the all this with one single operation if we use the revolve but we have to use a bit of our imagination [0:07:34]
 because we need to look at this and figure out the profile if we look at it from the front [0:07:39]
 we can get the profile quite easily just by drawing around this but we've got internal features [0:07:46]
 we need to think about in here. So if this was sliced in two we can see the internal features in [0:07:55]
 here for instance then we just slice this object into. I'm going to use the part workbench. [0:08:00]
 Now you don't have to do this this is just me slicing this for demonstration and I'm going to create [0:08:06]
 a cross section so I'm going to take that body and we use the cross section and we need to be on the right [0:08:13]
 plane which is that one and one section that's hit okay so it's created this cross section there [0:08:19]
 it's pressed the space bar and you can see what the cross section looks like. Now what we use a revolve [0:08:27]
 is it has to revolve around an axis so you need to revolve around the middle. If I view the [0:08:34]
 axis cross by a toggle net you can see it's there anything to the left of this we would use as [0:08:42]
 the profile for the revolution so we take this part here and just revolve it around here. [0:08:47]
 That's do this so that's remove all of done so I'm just going to delete the body [0:08:54]
 and delete this one we could leave this one for reference but I don't think we need it let's start [0:09:01]
 from fresh so I'm going to come back over to the part design and we'll create a body and create [0:09:06]
 the sketch this time we need to pick a different plane that I want to go in from the top [0:09:12]
 doesn't matter really because we can just flip it over if we wanted to. [0:09:16]
 I'm going to go for the axis said plane. Now that's start sketching one side of the axis so we're [0:09:24]
 looking at the left side I'm going to use the polyline and it's got to be close sketch so I'm going [0:09:30]
 to come up and let's say from the center here come up to the top and this is the top part so we're [0:09:40]
 going to go to constraints on and avoid redundant constraints you can see that down here [0:09:43]
 and what we're going to do is come down cross up and then say this way and come down again [0:09:53]
 and connect to that line and we want to hold in here as well so we need to come up [0:10:00]
 like so and come across a hit escape to go mouse point back and again I'm going to remove the [0:10:07]
 constraint from in here so just going to delete that so that releases that line which is [0:10:13]
 going to put these two together because we shouldn't attach it to the middle there and those together [0:10:19]
 it's quick on the redundant constraints and delete them so that one's there I need to keep that one [0:10:25]
 horizontal and that point on that line we're pointing line constraint and straight away we [0:10:32]
 basically got the profile that we're going to use I would go in and basically look all this down [0:10:41]
 all this geometry down but this gives you an idea of how this will be created so something like that [0:10:49]
 if I hit close we've got the profile here now what to do is click on that sketch and then use the [0:10:58]
 revolve to revolve this around and then we have our starts of our cook or not the revolution is [0:11:06]
 round for 160 and its axis is round the vertical sketch axis now this is important let me okay that [0:11:14]
 so you can see that there and you'll notice that the axis cross goes right through the center of [0:11:21]
 that if we come into the sketch this is the vertical sketch axis and it sits upon there and you can [0:11:30]
 see the point on line constraints here if I delete those so I can move this out so I'm just clicking [0:11:38]
 on those constraints and deleting them that frees up this one for move this away from this line [0:11:44]
 what'll happen is that we'll get a hole in there obviously we can use that to our advantage [0:11:50]
 so we've got a small hole in the top going all the way through if I cross that line we'll end [0:11:58]
 that with problems we need to keep to the left of this line if I hit close what you'll see on the left [0:12:03]
 hand side is there's an exclamation mark on the last action which is the revolution well [0:12:09]
 actually you can see it's much simpler because we've only got one action in here this one here [0:12:14]
 and that's because the revolve has gone past this vertical sketch axis so this here is the vertical [0:12:22]
 sketch axis we just need to place it up on there with a point on line constraint and let's make [0:12:30]
 sure that's got some vertical constraint there as well so it's quite simple to do with a revolve [0:12:37]
 again if we're going to revolve around this axis we mustn't cross it we can cross this one [0:12:44]
 we just mustn't cross the axis is that we're going to revolve around so this profile [0:12:49]
 I close that you can see we've basically done everything that we need with one operation [0:12:56]
 you notice this is quoted a number of flat faces so these planar faces here this planar faces [0:13:03]
 is a planar face it's a long one plane and we can attach sketches to those and those will [0:13:09]
 create it because the sketch has these horizontal aligned geometry here and here this will make [0:13:19]
 the curves so this one here gets revolve so this will be a curve and this will be a planar faces [0:13:24]
 well so these all create planar faces now if we go back and have a look a lot of cook cook [0:13:31]
 troll knobs have a curve surface so if this was say we're just done this with a struze if we [0:13:39]
 wanted to curve this surface we would have to come in and say add a fillet and curve this around [0:13:47]
 like so when we're using the revolve we can factor this in so we look at the sketch [0:13:58]
 one needs to do is come in and remove this line here and delete that it's bring this up a little [0:14:04]
 and we'll add in an arc between these two points auto-construining on there and just add the arc in [0:14:15]
 like so a little bit of adjustment just to get it right and this is where constrain and [0:14:24]
 locking this down comes in handy it makes this adjust me much easy so here's something like that [0:14:31]
 I hit close now you'll notice that this seam now runs all the way up and we get a curve top [0:14:38]
 so we're now created quite simple and very quick control knob on there with one single action [0:14:48]
 now if you look at control knobs what you'll notice is that we're able to orientate the objects [0:14:55]
 because we would have some kind of ridge that runs long here showing where the top part is so this [0:15:02]
 would be on zero on the cooker so we can rotate this around that's really easy to do with this because [0:15:10]
 we can utilize one of the operations that we was talking about earlier called a sweep [0:15:14]
 sweep needs a path and a profile we'll just show you how sweep works in a new document [0:15:22]
 the great new document and in here we create a body and we're creating a profile [0:15:30]
 now I'm going to use a profile along the exit z plane now the profile I'm going to use is just basically [0:15:38]
 a slot and that's just get rid of I know that will be the redundant constraint there so we've [0:15:45]
 got that this is just the profile so we close that we're going to create a path now [0:15:51]
 so to do that I need to create another sketch or I can use something from a existing object [0:16:00]
 like an edge or a seam in between somewhere so you probably can figure out how we're going to add that [0:16:05]
 bridge in there back with our example so that's put this on the xy plane and let's go through [0:16:13]
 that and I'm just going to add something in here that's going to go for an arc and connect that point [0:16:21]
 this is going to be the path and we're just going to place the arc in there like so [0:16:26]
 I can use this profile along this path so I can take that sketch this one here and sweep it along this path [0:16:40]
 to do that I use the additive pipe or to part design these are or additive features so [0:16:49]
 create an additive feature and use the additive pipe pipe and sweep are the same thing [0:16:54]
 so first it's going to ask us to select a feature that we want to sweep through the path [0:17:00]
 and I want this one here so just click that one there and you can see the profile is object [0:17:09]
 sketch if I already selected that when we're very first went in there that will be added in there [0:17:16]
 now it's asking us for a path so we add an edge or add an object and add an edge and click on this here [0:17:24]
 this is multiple edges then I'll just add an edge and then add another one on the end you can see [0:17:31]
 that material must be made we swept along that path so how can we use this in our original example [0:17:40]
 well that's close out of here and have a look we have a powerful ready so if you look at the [0:17:51]
 object we've got this scene these two edges so we can create a profile that sweeps along here [0:17:57]
 let's do that so I'm going to make sure that nothing is slet didn't get myself orientated [0:18:03]
 so I know I've got to create a profile along the YZ plane so like here that's great sketch [0:18:11]
 you can see the YZ planes there so that's great the sketch along the YZ plane is in the middle of [0:18:20]
 that object and you can see what was going to happen we're going to create the profile here [0:18:25]
 that's used a section view so we can see inside and we're zooming in a bit and start creating this profile [0:18:32]
 so I wanted to set about here and I'm going to use a line and we needed to be embedded in the object [0:18:44]
 like so and maybe a couple more lines so one up here and one up here [0:18:51]
 and an arc that sits on top of there so an arc that sits here [0:18:58]
 I'm going to take this point and place it along this line because I want to keep it symmetric [0:19:05]
 so that's all there and I need some horizontal constraint on there so we've got basically our profile [0:19:17]
 let's move this up need to keep these two points in line because of why it's going to look [0:19:27]
 extremely odd okay and we want something to say like that that's it close and have a look where that [0:19:39]
 sits so this is going to be our profile and it can be swept along this line here [0:19:47]
 so as we demonstrate it we click the sketch and then click on the active pipe [0:19:55]
 or part design great and add it to feature and it's quite [0:20:01]
 now we need to add the edge so I'm going to click add edge and add the top edge [0:20:08]
 and now we need this edge here as well so click add edge again and add that one [0:20:14]
 you can see what's happened and the material has been swept across there but it doesn't look right [0:20:22]
 it overhangs the bottom and I want it tapered to a point down here we can use another profile [0:20:32]
 so if we look down here we've got this section transformation and we can drop this down to [0:20:37]
 multi selection and in here we add additional profiles but we need an additional profile to add [0:20:45]
 onto that that's cancel out that's add one with profiles the best idea is to match the [0:20:51]
 number of edges so we look at this one and we hide the revolution we can see we've got a bottom [0:21:00]
 two sides and a curve at the top as long as we match the number of edges we can move between the [0:21:06]
 profiles even if it's a curved or straight etc bring the revolution back by pressing the space bar [0:21:13]
 and that's go to the bottom I'm going to create the sketch along here along this face [0:21:20]
 that's fine that seems here so let's bring this up and that's create the profile along there [0:21:33]
 we can do the same so basically it's just I'm going to go for the rectangle to make it life a lot easier [0:21:43]
 and we'd delete the top and create the arc between these so you're going to bet so I can see what I'm [0:21:51]
 doing and I'm not in there great the curve escape places point on this line point on object [0:22:02]
 constraint so let's make these lines equal so equal length and now we can pull in the side and [0:22:09]
 let's see what our profile will look like so I'm looking for something a bit smaller [0:22:17]
 wall lot smaller something like that and it's hit close now we've got a small profile and a large [0:22:27]
 one at the top let's see what happens when we create the sweep so we need to pick one of profile [0:22:32]
 so I'm going to pick the top one select the absence of pipe we now need to add the edges of [0:22:41]
 adage and select this edge adage gain so this one we can see it's not matching the profile of the [0:22:51]
 bottom so I'm going to zoom in that's come down to the left hand side and look at the section [0:22:58]
 transformation so that there's a multi section and then we add a section and we want this one in here [0:23:06]
 see how that's changed it's now in line with the bottom it doesn't overhang and you can see [0:23:13]
 it's wolfed between those profiles go up here okay and now we've got that top ridge running all the way along [0:23:27]
 we can add more profiles in here for instance we can add a profile in here and this will [0:23:34]
 smooth out this curve and makes the model look a bit more appealing but that's a simple [0:23:42]
 rotate with a sweep so you can see how those are used so we create this model in the part design [0:23:49]
 we would use the same sketches and a similar workflow in the part workbench but the question is where [0:23:55]
 would you use the part design over a part workbench workflow for revolve's and sweeps well we'll [0:24:01]
 be answering that question in our next video we'll be looking at part work flows and how much [0:24:07]
 flexible they are over the part design so I hope you enjoy these videos and I hope to see you in the next [0:24:13]
