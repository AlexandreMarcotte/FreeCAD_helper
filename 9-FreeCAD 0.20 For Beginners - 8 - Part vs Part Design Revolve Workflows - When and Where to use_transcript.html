===== START OF VIDEO: FreeCAD 0.20 For Beginners - 8 - Part vs Part Design Revolve Workflows - When and Where to use =====
 I have one and welcome to another episode of the Only Free Cat for Beginners, [0:00:04]
 where we teach the fundamentals of free cat with practical examples, [0:00:07]
 whilst following and understanding in workflows. This tutorial will carry on for the last week [0:00:12]
 where we looked at revolves and sweeps and this time we're going to be looking at [0:00:16]
 the part versus the part design. We're going to be focusing heavily on the part [0:00:21]
 web-inch and understanding how the part work-inch and it's for a full tool in there [0:00:26]
 differs from the part design and we'll learn flexibility of the part revolve using the [0:00:31]
 vertex edge, face, open sketch and close sketch. By the end of this tutorial we'll be demonstrating [0:00:38]
 each of those and you'll have a understanding of where we can use those in our projects. [0:00:43]
 So I hope you enjoyed these videos and that's how we look at this workflow. [0:00:46]

 span the channel. Some in the part design which is can talk about the previous video. [0:01:15]
 What we learn is that we've revolves, we can create a body in the create a sketch [0:01:20]
 in the part design. I'm going to go along the exit plane. [0:01:24]
 And we learn from a profile. I'm just going to use the polyline we can revolve [0:01:31]
 an object and we're just creating a very simple profile. [0:01:37]
 Like so and connect them up. We're going to redundant the strength because we need [0:01:45]
 this vertical strength deleted so I can hit delete on the keyboard. [0:01:48]
 So we've got a simple profile there and we learned we can use the revolve to revolve that. [0:01:53]
 And we can revolve it 360, whatever degrees we want. So just set that to 360. [0:02:01]
 Going back to the sketch we also learned about this axis which we're revolving around. [0:02:09]
 So for this one we're revolving around vertical axis and if I remove the online constraint here [0:02:16]
 the object constraint and move this off. And the same with this one. Actually we could leave this one [0:02:23]
 on, it doesn't matter. We learned that if we leave some gap in here that creates a whole away through. [0:02:30]
 And also if we cross line that we've revolving around then it goes into error. So you can see [0:02:38]
 the red X, my smart glare for error. [0:02:40]
 We'll also learn about filletting. So if we wanted to say curve off the top we don't need to use [0:02:50]
 a fillet or chamfer up. We can just delete the top part, bring this up slightly and add an arc. [0:02:58]
 So I'm going to use the end point of room point arc in here just to add a small curvature on that surface [0:03:04]
 and hit close. Therefore we get a curved surface. We can use that line to add such things as a profile [0:03:12]
 cross there to sweep across there. If we wanted to use a sweep to add more detail to this, [0:03:16]
 known in the plot design as an additive plate. And for that we can pick planar surface or the [0:03:25]
 base planes and create a sketch and find that seam. So that seems runs along here and we can add [0:03:34]
 something along this seam as I add. And we'll just lots of them on there. [0:03:40]
 Make sure we don't go into redundant constraints. So this is a profile that we're going to [0:03:45]
 place along this seam. Now hit close. That profile can be split across there. I mean we want [0:03:54]
 to never profile the other end to allow for it to be finished correctly. So that profile can be swept [0:04:02]
 using the additive pipe. We got the sketch in there. We were selected and we add an edge [0:04:08]
 and this one here and we can add this one if we want to bring this around. So I had an edge to this one [0:04:15]
 like so. Another profile at the end will smooth that out. I'm just going to remove that edge [0:04:21]
 and hit OK. So you can see we've got an edge as being used as a sweep path. I'm going to show [0:04:30]
 you how to do this in the part as well. We can actually do this in the part. I'll come in over to [0:04:35]
 the part and we'll remove this additive pipe and the revolve. So we've got the two sketches. [0:04:44]
 The profile and the revolve and then the part I'm not going to get rid of the body and just [0:04:51]
 going to leave the body there. It doesn't mean it's a part design object. The body is just a [0:04:55]
 container to contain these in. If I delete this body then I have to move the sketches out. But we're [0:04:59]
 just leave that there for the time being war in the part web edge. We can do exactly the same in here. [0:05:04]
 So we can take this sketch and revolve it along the z axis. So we got the z axis there. [0:05:11]
 OK. And use the sweep for this profile. Using the sweep and we need to pick [0:05:19]
 the sketch that we're going to use. So I want to use this sketch and click on it. We'll make [0:05:24]
 a green, we've it over. The sweep path we've got to select the path so I want to select this one. [0:05:31]
 It done. If I had other profiles in here I'll just add the minors while just moving across and here. [0:05:39]
 Making sure that sweep we've got the option to make that solid. So that's true. [0:05:46]
 So why should we use the path design over the path for doing basically exactly the same thing. [0:05:53]
 We've done that the same thing there. And create the same object. We look in here. The only difference [0:06:00]
 is that they're different objects. They're not one. And we can solve that by controlling both [0:06:06]
 them and using a Boolean to union those together. So it's usually union. So those are together now. [0:06:12]
 But what does the part give us over the part design? Well one thing in the part that you can do [0:06:17]
 that's get rid of this sweep. So I'm just going to delete the fusion and delete the sweep. [0:06:22]
 And come into the revolve. Have a look at this sketch. If I deleted this, say this top [0:06:31]
 line going around here, hit delete. Hit close. You can see we've gone into error. But if I click on the [0:06:38]
 revolve and come down to the solid, which is currently set to true. Set that to false, [0:06:44]
 then we've created a shell. So we've got an open sketch. We can't do this in a part design. [0:06:53]
 It will complain that the sketch is open. This allows us to do more advanced modeling and [0:06:59]
 more advanced surfacing. So I could create another revolving here or another sweep, etc. [0:07:04]
 And surface against those using the surface workbench. So we're starting to look at this workbench [0:07:10]
 and use it in a more organic way. So what we've done is used to hide that revolve. We've used [0:07:18]
 a sketch or an edge to allow us to revolve around that. So we've got more flexibility as well [0:07:26]
 as that we could use, say, a fur text as well. So I'm just going to delete all these and delete [0:07:33]
 the body as well and create a new sketch over in the sketch. I'll just [0:07:40]
 explain that's why-playing. If I create a number of fur fixes in here using the point, [0:07:46]
 create points, then I can create a number of points like so. Just quickly. So these four points here [0:07:55]
 if I hit close, you can't see those points at the moment. So we've got to convert them to, [0:07:59]
 so I'm known as construction geometry. So we've got back in, I'll click that and we'll highlight [0:08:05]
 with a box selection by clicking and dragging. So we've selected all those. Come up to the toolbar, [0:08:11]
 click on toggle construction geometry or kind of sketch, sketch geometries, toggle construction [0:08:18]
 geometry. These go white. That means when I hit close, we'll see them in our scene. So we can see [0:08:27]
 them there. So let's click on top so you can see them all there. So those are sitting in [0:08:34]
 our scene ready to be used. So they're there. Let's move these out just a bit more. [0:08:43]
 Well this allows me to do is basically take this sketch, which was created on the [0:08:57]
 top, so the xy plane, close, and that's fine on the top. Let's go around to the top. [0:09:05]
 I should have used my controls up here and position that onto the screen zoom out and let's bring this [0:09:13]
 around. So we've got those there. We can use that sketch in the part, these are fur fixes, [0:09:23]
 and use a revolve, and we're looking to revolve around the y axis, the y axis there, [0:09:30]
 and here, okay. We've created a number of profiles in there, so we've just revolved a vertex, [0:09:38]
 all vertices into edges. Travelers with this revolve, we can't do anything with this at the moment. [0:09:45]
 We need to break it apart. If it has a number of edges like this, then it's known as something [0:09:52]
 called a compound object. It's a collection of edges. The part workbench has compound tools. [0:09:59]
 If we look at the splode compound and click on that, what happens? We get a sploded revolve. [0:10:05]
 In there we have each of the edges that's been instructed out. Inside that edge you can see the [0:10:14]
 original revolve here, so this is the original revolve, and we can reuse that for one. [0:10:18]
 So the parts workbench uses a nested structure, and we can get back to the items we've in. [0:10:27]
 So this is what this revolve has been made with, and all these revolves you'll find that. [0:10:34]
 We have the same object in here. So I click and show one. They all show so they're all related to the [0:10:41]
 same object. What can do with these is come into say the loft. So we haven't been through lofting yet. [0:10:51]
 Lofting comes from boat making where you loft for a number of profiles to make the finished article. [0:10:57]
 Which in that case would be a boat? In this case we're going to be using these edges as profiles. [0:11:03]
 We're just click on the first one. These have got to be in order, so it's revolve 0. So let's double click that. [0:11:09]
 Double click the next one. You can see they're highlighting in order as we move down. [0:11:15]
 And double click the next one, and I can create this as a solid if I so you wish. [0:11:20]
 If I don't it'll just create it as a shell. See okay, and we've got our finished article. [0:11:27]
 If I wanted this to a point then that's the lead that loft and we've got our point in here. [0:11:34]
 Let's go back to the original revolve, so I'm just going to delete this one. [0:11:39]
 So we don't want to delete his contacts as well. So we just hit no the revolve comes back. [0:11:44]
 And we'll look at that sketch. Now if I add it another vertex. So on this line to [0:11:51]
 cause I want to loft this to a point. [0:11:53]
 Hit escape and click on that and made that construction geometry. So come up to this. [0:12:01]
 Took a stretch mode. It closed. [0:12:04]
 Then that's not been added to this. And if I try to revolve that, so I've just deleted the revolve. [0:12:12]
 Hit the lead and the keyboard. And using the revolve. And using the access that's built around [0:12:18]
 which is the y-axis. Hit okay. It goes into error. [0:12:24]
 So I need to take this one here to complete that. [0:12:33]
 Hit close. That's the layout I now. I've got create a new sketch or create a vertex somehow. [0:12:43]
 We could use the draw for a bench for instance. Great new sketch along the same plane. [0:12:49]
 Which was the y-z plane there. So y-z okay. [0:12:54]
 And we'll create another vertex. Say about here. [0:12:59]
 Make sure we click on it and create that as a construction. [0:13:06]
 Hit close. We've got this vertex here. Now we can loft through those profiles. [0:13:11]
 I'm going to take that revolve again. Come over to the part and use the compound tools. [0:13:17]
 So part compound and slow compound to get the individual. [0:13:23]
 Bring this there. And now we use the loft. [0:13:28]
 Or part. Come down to these operations here and want loft. [0:13:36]
 So that the first one which is going to be our point. [0:13:39]
 To point here. So we'll click that. Next one. So these have to be in order. [0:13:45]
 They'll click or we could use the right arrow key there. [0:13:49]
 You can leave it as a shell this time. So I'm not going to click. Crane solid. [0:13:56]
 Just to show you really. If I hit okay you can see what's happened there. [0:14:01]
 The vertex is a bit far away. [0:14:04]
 But for click on the loft, changes match degrees. Reduce that. [0:14:10]
 I get more of a less restrictive flow to that vertex. So you can see we haven't got crossovers there. [0:14:17]
 And that's that max degrees there. Maxime degrees. [0:14:21]
 Let's move that vertex down. So I'm going to come into that loft. We can see [0:14:27]
 all of the revolves in here. So if I click on one process base bob, this one will disappear as well. [0:14:34]
 And click on this one. You can see they are linked. [0:14:37]
 Let's take that sketch and bring this down. [0:14:42]
 Oh here and close it. [0:14:45]
 So I've created this bell shape here. This comes in real handy. If we quickly want to sketch something [0:14:53]
 that symmetrical. So let's delete all those. And I'm going to go to the image workbench. [0:15:02]
 I'm going to import an image. Which is in my download. [0:15:09]
 I'm going to use the bold impin image here and open that. [0:15:14]
 Put on the x-flight plane. [0:15:16]
 So you can see that I've got this image here of a bold impin. [0:15:23]
 Now for come over to the sketcher and what we normally do we have evolved. [0:15:29]
 So in the part design we would create a sketch along the x-flight plane. [0:15:34]
 And come in and start sketching this with the b-spline or a number of arcs in here. [0:15:43]
 So I'm going to use a b-spline to connect up our line and I'll try to be as quick as possible. [0:15:50]
 And see what b-spline will first of all we get straight lines. [0:15:58]
 Like so. If I hit escape then we get the b-spline lines here. [0:16:06]
 And we're not too bad but we have to position these in the right position. So we have to do some [0:16:14]
 tweaking afterwards to get all these correct and into position we may have to add new points. [0:16:22]
 But we need to take the b-spline and massage it into place. [0:16:31]
 And you know sometimes it can take a while to do this. [0:16:34]
 If I just wanted something like this and once I'm happy I hit close. [0:16:40]
 Then come over to the part. [0:16:42]
 I haven't closed the sketch so you're looking at the more flexibility of the part [0:16:47]
 when revolving because it doesn't need as a close sketch. [0:16:51]
 And we'll just rotate this around the wide direction and here okay. [0:16:56]
 So we've got our volume pin. [0:17:00]
 That's try this with vertexists and just going to delete that revolve and come into the sketch [0:17:05]
 and this time let's remove everything in here. [0:17:08]
 And we've got our image. [0:17:14]
 We've got the vertex and we'll start as the vertex is. [0:17:18]
 So remember that we don't add a vertex to this line here. [0:17:23]
 We have to keep away from it. [0:17:25]
 If we wanted to appoint them we add that as the second piece of geometry. [0:17:30]
 So you can see the top is flat and I can just add these in in different key positions. [0:17:37]
 So I'm going to go here and come into here. [0:17:41]
 And we'll just move this around until we've finished and didn't really need that one. [0:17:51]
 We'll put one in there and hit close. [0:17:54]
 Well, it's not hit close. [0:17:55]
 That's make sure that we've highlighted them all. [0:17:58]
 Now I don't want this middle one so I'm just going to click that one. [0:18:01]
 Here we have it and change those to construction. [0:18:05]
 Hit close. Now we've got those points. [0:18:07]
 We can revolve those around the boy axis. [0:18:13]
 Okay, we've now got our revolves. [0:18:17]
 Now take that revolve from the part. [0:18:21]
 We need to break those up into individual edges. [0:18:24]
 So come into the compound and explode compound. [0:18:27]
 We now got our exploded revolution. [0:18:30]
 We can now use the loft or part. [0:18:33]
 Come down to loft and then place all these into this column. [0:18:40]
 We can double click them and just stop. [0:18:45]
 We're going to top all those in. [0:18:47]
 Crazy, so that and here okay and we've rated our bullet pin quite quickly. [0:18:55]
 Much quicker than what would happen if we was to trace it. [0:18:58]
 We can hide all of these revolves by clicking on the actual folder of the press and space behind that. [0:19:04]
 Just hide some all that and we've got our ball in pin. [0:19:07]
 So for such things as rapid prototyping this comes in quite handy. [0:19:11]
 We've also got the concepts of an edge and a face that we can actually rotate as well. [0:19:17]
 So for our next demonstration we're going to revolve an edge. [0:19:19]
 I'm already in the sketcher and I'm going to create a sketch along the x-wight plane. [0:19:23]
 So we've got the sketch here and we'll create something like a track. [0:19:29]
 And the idea is to follow this track with a revolve. [0:19:34]
 So we have a circle object that can roll up the track and fit into the cross sectional to track. [0:19:41]
 So we'll use a basic rectangle and we'll add some circles. [0:19:49]
 Nice circle here one here and let me have a bit bigger here like that. [0:19:57]
 We use the trim to trim the tops of the circles away and we'll work back and trim the inside [0:20:04]
 so we get these arc sections here. [0:20:07]
 No one will hold fully constrain this but it's only a demonstration that's hit close. [0:20:12]
 So we've got this and we need to screw it over in the part workbench so we take the sketch [0:20:21]
 make sure it's slatted like a screwed we're going to go along the normal. [0:20:25]
 So remember when we create a sketch the normal is away from the sketch so it runs [0:20:31]
 this way here so no more sketch is this way. [0:20:35]
 Going this way and we'll set this to some in like 150 millimeters. [0:20:41]
 So now I've got this. [0:20:46]
 Well what do I want to do with it? I want to create a revolve that actually fits in here. [0:20:54]
 So first I need an axis to revolve around. [0:20:58]
 Kind of revolve around this axis because we're just get free spheres. [0:21:02]
 So we're going to come up a little and revolve around somewhere around about here for that I need a reference. [0:21:10]
 So we're going to sketch a reference on this face. So let this face come out to the sketcher. [0:21:17]
 That face is slatted. Now we'll create a new sketch it's going to map that to the face [0:21:24]
 and we want it to split face which is correct. So that's added to sketch the flat face. [0:21:29]
 It's flip to surround on the other side so you can see that there but that's fine. [0:21:34]
 I just want a straight line that lays like that. So this is going to be well going to revolve around. [0:21:44]
 I can set some distance away from here. [0:21:46]
 Yeah. Like so. Let's say 15 millimeters and this would be the diameter of the object that sits in here. [0:21:57]
 So now we've got that. We need to extract this edge. We're going to revolve this edge [0:22:05]
 around this axis to make that shape. So that we need to extract it and there are a number of ways [0:22:12]
 doing that one way to use the stove of work which will just curse workbench. [0:22:16]
 That allows us to just extract edges and connect it together. [0:22:19]
 Or we can utilize something in the part design. [0:22:23]
 Called Sub-shape binder or the shape binder and take these edges. [0:22:32]
 For that I need to select these edges. So I mix in the part design on the part together now. [0:22:40]
 But this doesn't need a body. It's just a tool on here that can be utilized outside the part design. [0:22:45]
 You can select this edge and control slats all the others. [0:22:51]
 So that edge is slatted now. If you're out of the part design and create a sub-objects shape binder [0:23:02]
 It goes to the model we can see a binder has been created there. [0:23:06]
 And if I click on the extrude and press the space bar we can see that edge has been removed from that object. [0:23:13]
 We're not removed it's been created from that object. I can now take that binder and use it in the revolve. [0:23:20]
 So let's come back over to the parts and use revolve. [0:23:26]
 So that binder is sitting there. This is what we're going to revolve. [0:23:31]
 Select a reference and select this line here and hit OK. [0:23:36]
 Though we've created the binders shape this is actually a shell. So this can be used as a shell. [0:23:42]
 It can also be used as solid we just need to close off the ends. [0:23:47]
 If I bring back this extrude we can see how it sits. [0:23:53]
 In this object. So this will roll in those grooves there. [0:24:01]
 Sure you how we close this up all we need to do is come over to the parts which we're already in [0:24:06]
 and listen tools in here and you see how the part can be used as a swiss army knife to allow you [0:24:15]
 to prototype objects quite quickly. So we've got the shape builder here. I click on that and we're [0:24:20]
 got a number of shapes that we can create. So we've got faces from first to seize faces from [0:24:26]
 edges. I'm not going to use the face for edges to close this up. So click faces from edges and we'll [0:24:31]
 select it's edge. Create. Come around to the other side. Select this edge. [0:24:38]
 And create. Hit close. Now I've got two faces and I revolve. [0:24:46]
 And we just take the revolve. Control put the face and the second face. Come out to part. [0:24:54]
 Come down to compound. Make a compound of those. So that's one compound. [0:25:00]
 We've all those free objects in and then we can come up to part and convert that to a solid. [0:25:08]
 That's hide the original compound. Now go to solid object. So this is a kind of thing that you'll [0:25:15]
 basically last to finish this off. And if I add, say, a sphere in here and give this some [0:25:23]
 radius. So you don't actually see it. In control R. So bring this up in size and I can see it's [0:25:32]
 slowly appearing. Right click transform. Then if I place it on top, I can see that this is a solid [0:25:42]
 right click on the one I want to keep. Control click on the sphere. When I want to remove and [0:25:48]
 use the cut. And you see that's cut into that. So we used a shape binder from the part design [0:25:54]
 over in the part to last create an edge. Use that edge in a revolve. Add faces to the ends just [0:26:04]
 to cap the top and the bottom. Convert that to a solid and then taking chunk out the solid. [0:26:10]
 Just to show that is a solid. So you can begin to see how the part is more gannick in the way [0:26:16]
 we're modeling. Whereas the part design restricts you down on a certain workflow allowing you to [0:26:21]
 use sketches and traditional CAD processes. Let's take this one step forward and look at a face [0:26:26]
 revolve. So we look to vertex. We look to vertices. We've looked at an edge. Let's look at a face. [0:26:33]
 So create a sketch along the x, y plane and the correct piping here. So we're going to be using [0:26:39]
 the slot to create some kind of piping. We're over constrain. So click the redoneck [0:26:49]
 strand here to delete. And now I can pull this in. I also place it along this edge. [0:26:57]
 Point on like the strength there. So basically we've got this shape and I think close [0:27:09]
 I'm going to extrude that over and part. And give us some astrusions of it like 15mm. [0:27:20]
 So we've got this ring here. I can ask some detail in here so that's and let's say sketch along this one. [0:27:33]
 So let's come over to the sketch. Great sketch. Let's go flat face on there. [0:27:39]
 And remember we're in the part web edge. So we're doing with Boolean's, [0:27:44]
 top fusions, etc. And that's imports and geometries. So let's import these edges. [0:27:53]
 That's reference. It goes as is there. And we'll create some detail. So I may want to place a circle [0:28:03]
 here and we'll also create a rectangle along there. [0:28:11]
 Bring this out. We're going to cut this. Let's take that constraint off. So I'll go [0:28:18]
 point on line and strain there. So let's delete that. I'll point on all of your constraints. Let's bring that up. [0:28:24]
 So just like that. Let's hit close. Go to the part and we'll extrude that. [0:28:30]
 And I can extrude it by some in like 7mm. And that's send that in the other direction. [0:28:42]
 So 7mm forwards. Let's go 1-7. So it's gone backwards. [0:28:46]
 It's 1-7 there. Take that astusion. [0:28:52]
 So that the one we want to keep, which is the very first astusion, [0:28:58]
 and control flat the other astusion. And we'll come up to the part, Boolean and cut. So we've added [0:29:07]
 some detail in there. And see how that's cut into this face. So we've got this single face here [0:29:16]
 with that cut in there. Now I want to take this face and rotate it. So I'm going to create a [0:29:23]
 rotation that goes this way. I'm going to rotate it over a reference point. So we'll keep this detail [0:29:32]
 in here and have it along the rotation. So to do that, I'm going to use the line as either [0:29:39]
 the part design. Subshake binder. So I'm going to click on that and create a subshake binder. [0:29:46]
 That last minute to do that. All, as a space I just hide that. Over in the draft work bench, [0:29:56]
 we've got something else to call it a face binder. Click that face. This is like one here, [0:30:02]
 face binder. Then come up to the draft in and face binder. That creates a face binder there. [0:30:09]
 You can see it just sitting on top of it. There's a high enough cut. It's just [0:30:15]
 structured on that face. Press the space bar to bring back there for object. [0:30:20]
 So we have that there and we can rotate that face. Coming over to the part [0:30:29]
 and using the rotate and it's going to rotate the whole face. So I want some kind of [0:30:37]
 rotation around this edge here. So that's try that. So we've got the face binder that's rotate. [0:30:43]
 Select reference and on this edge. So we've selected the cut edge. So this is not the face binder. [0:30:52]
 It's selected the cut edge. So this edge here. And that's rotate this around about [0:31:00]
 60 degrees and here. Okay. It's gone the other way, but we can resolve that [0:31:07]
 becoming to the revolve and using a minus 60. Send it the other direction. Okay. And it's [0:31:18]
 kept the deal of tailing on top. So we've got that detailing all the way into this part here. [0:31:26]
 Which allows us to place clips or some kind of connection point in here. [0:31:34]
 So the main one is the same as the part design where we rotate an actual closed wire. [0:31:42]
 So that's come over to the part which we already in and get rid of all these. Try those and delete them. [0:31:49]
 It's a great sketch. Okay, and we can go along the top and on the x-y plane. [0:31:56]
 X-y plane for new sketch. And remember in that's if we add [0:32:02]
 rectangle, it closed and use the revolve over and part. Then that revolve. [0:32:10]
 We're looking along the y. Okay. We'll revolve around there. Like so. [0:32:19]
 We could come into that sketch and move this beyond which we're caused an error. [0:32:26]
 So you can see that's gone into error there. So still, they're revolving. These are sketched [0:32:31]
 there. So we're still going to error and use the revolve. This time, select reference. [0:32:36]
 And we'll select the edge of that sketch and here. Okay. So we revolve around that edge. So we can get [0:32:43]
 away from the problems with Venus positioned that's away from the access just by using [0:32:49]
 reference in the sketch. We could come into that sketch and add another spark of the sketch. [0:33:00]
 So here, like so, it's closed that. False, caused an issue. So we'd delete that revolve [0:33:09]
 and revolve that again. And this time we could select the reference as in this edge. [0:33:15]
 And here, okay. It's not going to error anymore and we've revolved around that edge of that [0:33:24]
 sketch. So this one here. Just by moving that closer, we close that hole. So that allows us to [0:33:31]
 sets and distance in here. So we can be exact in that whole diameter. Save 10 millimeters [0:33:40]
 and hit close. See you to see that there. So over the last couple of videos, we've been looking at [0:33:47]
 revolve and sweeps. And now we're going to be doing a bit of project work. We've been learning [0:33:52]
 how to create this box and also this overbox. And understanding how the workflows differ between [0:34:00]
 both of these. Because obviously we can't use a revolve for the overbox. So what do we use? [0:34:07]
 We're going to be using the plant design and we're going to be introducing shape binders and [0:34:12]
 multi-body modeling. So I hope you enjoy this series and I hope to see you again in the next video. [0:34:16]
